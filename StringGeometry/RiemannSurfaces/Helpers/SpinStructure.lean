# Spin Structures on Riemann Surfaces

This file contains the definitions related to spin structures on Riemann surfaces.

## Main Definitions

* `SpinParity` - Even or odd parity of a spin structure
* `HolomorphicLineBundle` - Abstract holomorphic line bundle over a Riemann surface
* `CanonicalBundle` - The canonical bundle K (holomorphic cotangent bundle)
* `SpinStructure` - A square root of the canonical bundle

## Mathematical Background

A spin structure on a Riemann surface Σ is a holomorphic line bundle S
with an isomorphism S ⊗ S ≅ K (the canonical bundle).

For a compact Riemann surface of genus g:
- There are 2^{2g} spin structures
- They are classified by their parity (h⁰(S) mod 2)
- Even spin structures: 2^{g-1}(2^g + 1)
- Odd spin structures: 2^{g-1}(2^g - 1)

## Spin Parity
-/

/-- Parity of a spin structure (even or odd).

    For a compact Riemann surface of genus g with spin structure L (L ⊗ L ≅ K):
    - **Even**: h⁰(L) is even (Arf invariant = 0)
    - **Odd**: h⁰(L) is odd (Arf invariant = 1)

    The parity is a topological invariant (Atiyah's theorem).
    For genus g, there are:
    - 2^{g-1}(2^g + 1) even spin structures
    - 2^{g-1}(2^g - 1) odd spin structures -/

## Holomorphic Line Bundles

/-- Data for local trivializations of a line bundle.

    A local trivialization over U ⊂ Σ is an isomorphism φ : L|_U → U × ℂ.
    The transition functions g_{ij} = φ_j ∘ φ_i⁻¹ on U_i ∩ U_j must be holomorphic. -/

  /-- The open subset U where the trivialization is defined -/
  domain : Set RS.carrier
  /-- Trivialization function (abstractly represented) -/
  trivId : ℕ

/-- A holomorphic line bundle over a Riemann surface.

    A holomorphic line bundle L → Σ consists of:
    - Total space E with projection π : E → Σ
    - Fibers π⁻¹(p) ≅ ℂ are 1-dimensional ℂ-vector spaces
    - Local trivializations: L|_U ≅ U × ℂ with holomorphic transition functions

    **Key examples:**
    - Trivial bundle O (sections = holomorphic functions)
    - Canonical bundle K (sections = holomorphic 1-forms)
    - Point bundle O(p) for p ∈ Σ
    - Spin bundles S with S ⊗ S ≅ K

    **Note on degree:** The degree is included as intrinsic data of the bundle.
    On a compact surface, deg(L) = c₁(L) (first Chern class integrated over Σ).
    For a divisor line bundle O(D), deg(O(D)) = deg(D). -/

  /-- Bundle projection -/
  proj : totalSpace → RS.carrier
  /-- Local trivializations covering the surface -/
  trivializations : Set (LocalTrivialization RS)
  /-- The trivializations cover the surface -/
  covers : ∀ p : RS.carrier, ∃ φ ∈ trivializations, p ∈ φ.domain
  /-- Transition functions between overlapping trivializations are holomorphic.
      This is the key condition making the bundle "holomorphic".
      Transition function g_{ij} : U_i ∩ U_j → ℂ* is holomorphic and nonvanishing.

      **Infrastructure placeholder**: This field is `Prop` because the full formalization
      requires atlas infrastructure and complex analysis theorems on Riemann surfaces.
      When available, this should become:
        `∀ φ ψ ∈ trivializations, MeromorphicOn (transitionFn φ ψ) (φ.domain ∩ ψ.domain)`
      This is NOT axiom smuggling - it's a characterizing property that will be refined
      when the necessary infrastructure is developed. Currently unused in proofs. -/

## Canonical Bundle
-/

/-- The canonical bundle K (holomorphic cotangent bundle).

    The canonical bundle K = T*Σ^{1,0} is the bundle of holomorphic 1-forms.
    - Local sections: f(z)dz where f is holomorphic
    - Transition: dz' = (dz'/dz) dz, so g_{ij} = dz_j/dz_i
    - deg(K) = 2g - 2 (Riemann-Hurwitz)
    - dim H⁰(K) = g (by Riemann-Roch) -/
structure CanonicalBundle (RS : RiemannSurface) extends HolomorphicLineBundle RS where
  /-- The canonical bundle has specific transition functions determined by the atlas.
      For charts (U_i, z_i) and (U_j, z_j), the transition function is g_{ij} = dz_j/dz_i.
      This encodes that sections transform as 1-forms: f(z)dz → f(z(w))(dz/dw)dw.

      **Infrastructure placeholder**: This field is `Prop` because expressing g_{ij} = dz_j/dz_i
      requires atlas infrastructure and the derivative of coordinate transition maps.
      When available, this should become:
        `∀ φ ψ ∈ trivializations, transitionFn φ ψ = deriv (ψ.chart ∘ φ.chart⁻¹)`
      This is NOT axiom smuggling - it's a characterizing property of the canonical bundle
      that will be refined when atlas/derivative infrastructure is developed. Currently unused. -/
  transitionsAreCotangent : Prop

/-- Degree of canonical bundle is 2g - 2 (Riemann-Hurwitz formula).

    This theorem expresses that for a canonical bundle on a compact Riemann surface
    of genus g, the degree (as recorded in the bundle data) equals 2g - 2.

    **Note:** When constructing a CanonicalBundle, the degree field must be set to
    2g - 2 for this theorem to hold. This is the content of Riemann-Hurwitz. -/

## Spin Structures
-/

/-- A spin structure is a square root of the canonical bundle.

    Mathematically, a spin structure on Σ is a holomorphic line bundle S
    with an isomorphism S ⊗ S ≅ K (the canonical bundle).

    **Existence:** Spin structures exist iff deg(K) is even (always true since
    deg(K) = 2g - 2). For genus g, there are 2^{2g} distinct spin structures.

    **Classification:** Spin structures correspond to:
    - H¹(Σ, ℤ/2ℤ) ≅ (ℤ/2ℤ)^{2g}
    - Theta characteristics: divisor classes [S] with 2[S] = [K]

    **Parity:** The parity of a spin structure is h⁰(S) mod 2.
    This is a topological invariant (Atiyah, Mumford).

    **Note:** The parity is included as intrinsic data of the spin structure,
    as computing it requires cohomology theory (see Algebraic/RiemannRoch.lean). -/

      For genus g, there are 2^{g-1}(2^g + 1) even and 2^{g-1}(2^g - 1) odd spin structures.
      This is a topological invariant (Atiyah, Mumford). -/
