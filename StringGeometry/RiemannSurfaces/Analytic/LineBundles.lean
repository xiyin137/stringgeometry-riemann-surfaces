# Holomorphic Line Bundles on Riemann Surfaces

This file develops the theory of holomorphic line bundles on Riemann surfaces
from the **analytic** perspective.

## Mathematical Background

A holomorphic line bundle L → Σ is a complex line bundle with holomorphic
transition functions. The key correspondence is:

  **Divisors ↔ Line Bundles ↔ Pic(Σ)**

Given a divisor D, the associated line bundle O(D) has:
- Sections: meromorphic functions f with (f) + D ≥ 0
- The space of global sections: L(D) = H⁰(Σ, O(D))

### Key Definitions

- **O(D)**: The line bundle associated to divisor D
- **L(D) = H⁰(O(D))**: Space of global sections
- **h⁰(D) = dim L(D)**: Dimension of section space

## Holomorphic Line Bundles

A holomorphic line bundle is a complex line bundle with holomorphic structure.

/-- A holomorphic line bundle on a Riemann surface.

    In the analytic approach, a line bundle is characterized by:
    - Its underlying topological line bundle
    - Holomorphic transition functions
    - The associated divisor (up to linear equivalence)

    For simplicity, we define it via its associated divisor class.
    Line bundles form a group under tensor product: O(D₁) ⊗ O(D₂) = O(D₁ + D₂). -/

## Global Sections

L(D) = { f meromorphic : (f) + D ≥ 0 }

This is the space of meromorphic functions whose poles are "cancelled" by D.
-/

/-- The linear system L(D): meromorphic functions f with (f) + D ≥ 0.

    This is a ℂ-vector space (in fact, finite-dimensional for compact surfaces).

    **TODO:** Add vector space structure to compute h⁰(D) = dim L(D). -/

  /-- A section is a meromorphic function with (f) + D ≥ 0 -/

  /-- The divisor condition: div(f) + D is effective -/
  effective : Divisor.Effective (divisorOf fn + D)
  /-- The regularValue function is holomorphic (MDifferentiable in charts) at non-pole points.

      This is the key analytical condition connecting the abstract AMF structure
      to the complex geometry of the Riemann surface. At any point p where
      fn.order p ≥ 0 (non-pole), the function fn.regularValue is complex-differentiable
      in the manifold sense, i.e., holomorphic in local coordinates.

      Without this condition, the AMF is purely algebraic and has no connection
      to the smooth/holomorphic structure of the underlying Riemann surface. -/
  holomorphicAway : ∀ p, 0 ≤ fn.order p →
    @MDifferentiableAt ℂ _ ℂ _ _ ℂ _ 𝓘(ℂ, ℂ) RS.carrier RS.topology RS.chartedSpace
      ℂ _ _ ℂ _ 𝓘(ℂ, ℂ) ℂ _ _ fn.regularValue p
  /-- The regularValue function is meromorphic in every chart.

      This is the full analytical condition: at EVERY point (including poles),
      the chart representation `fn.regularValue ∘ (extChartAt p).symm` is
      `MeromorphicAt` in the sense of Mathlib.

      At non-pole points, this follows from `holomorphicAway` (holomorphic → analytic
      → meromorphic). At poles, this captures the essential Laurent expansion behavior:
      multiplying by a suitable power of the local coordinate makes the function analytic.

      This field is critical for the argument principle and zero-counting arguments. -/
  chartMeromorphic : ∀ p,
    letI := RS.topology
    letI := RS.chartedSpace
    MeromorphicAt (fn.regularValue ∘ (extChartAt 𝓘(ℂ, ℂ) p).symm) (extChartAt 𝓘(ℂ, ℂ) p p)
  /-- The chart-local meromorphic order matches the abstract AMF order.

      This is the soundness condition connecting the abstract `fn.order` field
      (an integer assigned per point by the AMF structure) to the analytic
      `meromorphicOrderAt` computed from the Laurent expansion in charts.

      At non-pole points (order ≥ 0), this follows from `holomorphicAway`:
      the function is analytic, so the analytic order matches the zero order.
      At poles (order < 0), this requires the Laurent expansion to have the
      correct leading term, which is part of the analytical content of the section.

      This field is critical for reducing `zero_counting_linear_combination`
      to the argument principle: it lets us bound the chart-order of a
      linear combination Σ cᵢ fᵢ using the AMF orders of the individual fᵢ. -/
  chartOrderAt_eq : ∀ p,
    letI := RS.topology
    letI := RS.chartedSpace
    chartOrderAt (RS := RS) fn.regularValue p = (fn.order p : WithTop ℤ)

/-- The linear system L(D) is empty when deg(D) < 0.

    **Proof idea:**
    If f ∈ L(D), then div(f) + D ≥ 0, so deg(div(f)) + deg(D) ≥ 0.
    By the argument principle, deg(div(f)) = 0 for meromorphic functions.
    Thus deg(D) ≥ 0, contradicting deg(D) < 0. -/
