# Maximum Principle for Harmonic Functions

This file develops the maximum principle for harmonic functions by bridging
from Mathlib's maximum modulus principle for holomorphic functions.

## Mathematical Background

The maximum principle for harmonic functions states: if a harmonic function u
attains its maximum at an interior point of a connected domain, then u is constant.

**Proof Strategy**: We use the mean value property. If u(z₀) is a maximum, then
by the mean value property, u(z₀) equals the average over any small circle around z₀.
Since u ≤ u(z₀) everywhere, and the average equals u(z₀), we must have u = u(z₀)
on the entire circle. Iterating this argument across the connected domain gives
the result.

## Main Results

* `harmonic_eq_of_circleAverage_eq` - f = M on sphere if average = M and f ≤ M
* `harmonic_maximum_principle_ball` - maximum principle on balls
* `harmonic_maximum_principle_connected` - maximum principle on connected open sets

## Circle Average Lemmas

Key lemma: if f is continuous, f ≤ M on sphere, and circleAverage f = M, then f = M on sphere.
-/

/-- If a continuous function satisfies f ≤ M on a sphere and its circle average equals M,
    then f = M everywhere on the sphere.

    **Proof**: Let g = M - f ≥ 0 on sphere. The average of g is M - M = 0.
    Since g ≥ 0 and has zero average, g = 0 a.e. by integral theory.
    By continuity, g = 0 everywhere, so f = M. -/

## Maximum Principle from Mean Value Property

The key insight is that if u(z₀) = max and u(z₀) = (average over circle),
then u must equal u(z₀) on the entire circle (since all values ≤ max).

/-- Strong maximum principle for harmonic functions on a ball:
    If a harmonic function attains its maximum at the center, it's constant.

    This is the key lemma. The proof uses the mean value property:
    if f(z₀) = max and f(z₀) = average, then f = f(z₀) everywhere. -/
