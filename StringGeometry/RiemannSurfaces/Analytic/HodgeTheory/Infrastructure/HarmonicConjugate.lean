# Harmonic Conjugate Theory

This file develops the theory of harmonic conjugates using Mathlib's theorem
that harmonic functions on balls are real parts of holomorphic functions.

## Mathematical Background

If u : ℂ → ℝ is harmonic, then locally there exists v : ℂ → ℝ (the harmonic conjugate)
such that f = u + iv is holomorphic. The function v is unique up to a constant.

The key insight is that Mathlib's `harmonic_is_realOfHolomorphic` gives us:
  HarmonicOnNhd f (ball z R) → ∃ F : ℂ → ℂ, AnalyticOnNhd ℂ F (ball z R) ∧ f = Re ∘ F

The imaginary part Im ∘ F is then the harmonic conjugate.

## Main Results

* `harmonic_conjugate_exists_ball` - Local existence on balls
* `harmonic_conjugate_exists_at` - Local existence at a point

## Global Existence on Simply Connected Domains

On simply connected domains, the harmonic conjugate exists globally (not just locally).
The proof uses that simply connected domains in ℂ are contractible to a point,
so any local construction can be extended globally without monodromy issues.
-/

/-- On a simply connected domain, a harmonic function has a global harmonic conjugate.

    **Mathematical Background**:
    If u is harmonic, the 1-form ω = -∂u/∂y dx + ∂u/∂x dy is closed (dω = 0 because Δu = 0).
    On simply connected domains, the Poincaré lemma says closed forms are exact.
    So there exists v with dv = ω, i.e., ∂v/∂x = -∂u/∂y and ∂v/∂y = ∂u/∂x.
    These are exactly the Cauchy-Riemann equations, so u + iv is holomorphic.

    **Proof Approach 1 (Path Integration)**:
    1. Fix a basepoint z₀ ∈ U
    2. Define v(z) = ∫_γ ω where γ is any path from z₀ to z in U
    3. Show v is well-defined: for any two paths γ₁, γ₂ from z₀ to z,
       γ₁ - γ₂ is a loop, and since U is simply connected, this loop is null-homotopic
    4. For closed forms, homotopic paths give the same integral
    5. Hence v is well-defined and satisfies Cauchy-Riemann with u

    **Proof Approach 2 (Sheaf/Covering)**:
    1. Local conjugates exist by `harmonic_conjugate_exists_ball`
    2. On overlaps, conjugates differ by constants (since differences are locally constant)
    3. Use path-connectedness to fix constants consistently
    4. Simply connectedness ensures this construction is consistent (no monodromy)

    **Required Mathlib Infrastructure**:
    - Curve integrals of 1-forms: Available in `Mathlib.MeasureTheory.Integral.CurveIntegral`
    - Homotopy invariance of curve integrals for closed forms: Not yet formalized
    - Poincaré lemma: In progress (PR #24019 mentioned in Mathlib)
    - `SimplyConnectedSpace`: Available in `Mathlib.AlgebraicTopology.FundamentalGroupoid.SimplyConnected` -/
