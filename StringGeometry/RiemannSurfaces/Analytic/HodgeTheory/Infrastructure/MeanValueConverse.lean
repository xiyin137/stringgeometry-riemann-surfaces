# Mean Value Property Implies Harmonicity

This file proves the converse of the mean value property: if a continuous function
on an open set satisfies the mean value property everywhere, then it is harmonic.

## Mathematical Background

**Theorem (Converse of Mean Value Property)**: Let U ⊆ ℂ be open, and let f : U → ℝ
be continuous. If f satisfies the mean value property:
  f(z₀) = (1/2π) ∫₀^{2π} f(z₀ + re^{iθ}) dθ
for all z₀ ∈ U and all r > 0 with B(z₀, r) ⊆ U, then f is harmonic on U.

**Proof**: The proof goes through the Poisson integral representation developed in
`PoissonIntegral.lean`. For each point z ∈ U, we take a small closed ball around z
contained in U, and apply `mvp_implies_harmonicOnNhd` which shows that continuous
functions satisfying MVP on a closed ball are harmonic on the open ball.

## Main Results

* `harmonicOnNhd_of_mvp` - MVP on open set implies harmonic
* `harmonicOn_of_continuous_mean_value` - Standard formulation with ball containment

## Mean Value Property Characterization

The key insight is that the mean value property characterizes harmonic functions.
-/

/-- A function satisfies the mean value property on a set if for every interior point
    and every ball contained in the set, the function value equals the circle average. -/
def SatisfiesMVP (f : ℂ → ℝ) (U : Set ℂ) : Prop :=
  ∀ z ∈ U, ∀ r > 0, closedBall z r ⊆ U → f z = circleAverage f z r

/-- The mean value property restricted to a single point with all valid radii. -/
def SatisfiesMVPAt (f : ℂ → ℝ) (z : ℂ) (U : Set ℂ) : Prop :=
  ∀ r > 0, closedBall z r ⊆ U → f z = circleAverage f z r

/-- SatisfiesMVP implies SatisfiesMVPAt at every point. -/

## Main Theorem: Mean Value Property Implies Harmonicity

The proof uses the Poisson integral infrastructure from `PoissonIntegral.lean`:
1. For each point z in U, take a small closed ball B̄(z, R/2) ⊆ U
2. Apply `mvp_implies_harmonicOnNhd` which shows MVP + continuous → harmonic
3. This gives HarmonicAt f z

/-- Main theorem: If f is continuous on an open set and satisfies the mean value
    property, then f is harmonic.

    This is a fundamental characterization of harmonic functions. The proof
    localizes to closed balls and applies the Poisson integral representation
    from `PoissonIntegral.lean`. -/
