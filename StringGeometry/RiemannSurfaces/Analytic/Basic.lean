# Analytic Theory: Complex Manifold Structure

This file provides the analytic (complex-analytic) definition of Riemann surfaces
as connected 1-dimensional complex manifolds.

## Mathematical Background

A Riemann surface is a connected complex manifold of complex dimension 1.
This means:
1. A topological space with charts to open subsets of ℂ
2. Transition functions are holomorphic (complex differentiable)
3. Connected

## Relationship to Other Definitions

- **Analytic** (this file): Complex manifolds, holomorphic functions
- **Algebraic** (Algebraic/): Smooth projective curves over ℂ
- **GAGA**: For compact surfaces, these are equivalent

This file is imported by the main Basic.lean for backward compatibility.

## Main Definitions

* `RiemannSurface` - A connected 1-dimensional complex manifold
* `CompactRiemannSurface` - A compact Riemann surface with genus

## Complex Manifold Structure via Mathlib

We use Mathlib's `IsManifold (modelWithCornersSelf ℂ ℂ) ∞ M` for complex manifold structure.
The model `modelWithCornersSelf ℂ ℂ` uses ℂ as the scalar field, so `ContDiffOn ℂ n` checks
ℂ-differentiability (Fréchet derivative is ℂ-linear), which is equivalent
to holomorphicity via Cauchy-Riemann equations.

The key theorem bridging these notions is `DifferentiableOn.contDiffOn` from
`Mathlib.Analysis.Complex.CauchyIntegral`: on open sets, complex differentiability
implies `ContDiffOn ℂ n` for any n, since holomorphic functions are analytic.

## Complex Manifold Structure

Mathlib provides `IsManifold I n M` for n-times differentiable manifolds.
For complex manifolds of dimension 1, we use:
- Model: `modelWithCornersSelf ℂ ℂ` (the identity model with corners on ℂ)
- Smoothness: `∞` (smooth, which for ℂ means holomorphic/analytic)

The `IsManifold (modelWithCornersSelf ℂ ℂ) ∞ M` class requires transition functions to be
`ContDiffOn ℂ ∞`, i.e., infinitely ℂ-differentiable. Since ℂ-differentiability
requires the Fréchet derivative to be ℂ-linear (equivalent to Cauchy-Riemann),
this gives exactly the structure of a complex manifold with holomorphic transitions.

## Riemann Surface Definition
-/

/-- A Riemann surface is a connected 1-dimensional complex manifold.

    A Riemann surface consists of:
    1. A topological space M that is Hausdorff and second countable
    2. A ChartedSpace structure over ℂ (atlas of charts to ℂ)
    3. Holomorphic transition functions (IsManifold (modelWithCornersSelf ℂ ℂ) ∞)
    4. Connectedness

    **1-dimensionality:** The complex dimension is 1 because the model space is ℂ
    (not ℂⁿ for n > 1). This is encoded in `ChartedSpace ℂ M` where the model
    space ℂ has dim_ℂ = 1. Equivalently, it has real dimension 2.

    **Complex manifold structure:** We use Mathlib's `IsManifold (modelWithCornersSelf ℂ ℂ) ∞ M`
    which requires transitions to be `ContDiffOn ℂ ∞`. Since ℂ-differentiability
    (Fréchet derivative being ℂ-linear) is equivalent to holomorphicity via
    Cauchy-Riemann, this gives a complex manifold with holomorphic transitions.

    **Key invariants:**
    - Riemann surfaces are orientable (ℂ ≅ ℝ² with standard orientation)
    - Connected Riemann surfaces are classified by their topology (genus for compact)
    - Every Riemann surface has a unique complex structure compatible with its atlas -/

/-- The carrier of a Riemann surface is infinite.

    **Proof:** By contradiction. If the carrier were finite, then a chart
    would map a finite open subset to an open subset of ℂ. But open subsets
    of ℂ that are finite must be clopen (finite = closed in T1 space, open by
    hypothesis). Since ℂ is connected, the only nonempty clopen set is ℂ itself.
    But ℂ is infinite, contradicting finiteness. -/

## Riemann Sphere

The Riemann sphere ℂP¹ = ℂ ∪ {∞} is the one-point compactification of ℂ.
It has a two-chart atlas:
- φ₀: ℂ → ℂ (identity on the finite part)
- φ₁: (OnePoint ℂ) \ {0} → ℂ, z ↦ 1/z with ∞ ↦ 0

The transition function φ₁ ∘ φ₀⁻¹(z) = 1/z is holomorphic on ℂ \ {0}.

**Note:** Full construction of the charted space structure requires significant
infrastructure. We provide the structure with placeholders that should be
filled in when Mathlib has better support for one-point compactification
as a manifold.
-/

/-- The finite chart on the Riemann sphere: embeds ℂ into OnePoint ℂ.

    This chart covers everything except the point at infinity.
    The source is `Set.range (↑)` (the image of the coercion ℂ → OnePoint ℂ).

    Construction uses the symm of the open embedding's partial homeomorphism:
    `coe : ℂ → OnePoint ℂ` is an open embedding, so its symm gives a partial
    homeomorphism from `OnePoint ℂ` to `ℂ` with source = range coe. -/

## Compact Riemann Surfaces and Genus
-/

/-- A compact Riemann surface with specified genus.

    **Why genus is in the structure:**
    Mathematically, genus is determined by the topology: g = dim H₁(Σ, ℤ) / 2.
    Mathlib has singular homology (`AlgebraicTopology.singularHomologyFunctor`)
    but lacks computations for specific spaces like spheres or tori.

    Until such computations are available, we include genus as part of the
    structure, which is equivalent to working with "labeled" Riemann surfaces
    as is common in moduli theory.

    **Characterization:** For a compact Riemann surface of genus g:
    - χ = 2 - 2g (Euler characteristic)
    - dim H₁(Σ, ℤ) = 2g (first Betti number)
    - deg(K) = 2g - 2 (canonical bundle degree) -/
structure CompactRiemannSurface extends RiemannSurface where
  /-- Compactness -/

  /-- The topological genus -/
  genus : ℕ

/-- On a compact connected Riemann surface, every holomorphic function is constant.

    This is the analytic analogue of `regularIsConstant` in the algebraic approach.
    Uses Mathlib's maximum modulus principle: `MDifferentiable.exists_eq_const_of_compactSpace`

    **Proof**: A compact Riemann surface is a compact connected complex manifold.
    By the maximum modulus principle, any holomorphic function attains its maximum,
    and by connectedness, this forces the function to be constant. -/
