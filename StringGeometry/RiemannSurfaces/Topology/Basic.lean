# Basic Topology for Riemann Surfaces

This file contains foundational topological results needed for Riemann surface theory.

## Main results

* `Complex.isPreconnected_univ` - The complex plane is preconnected
* Properties of OnePoint ℂ (Riemann sphere topology)

## Mathematical Background

ℂ is connected because it is convex (hence path-connected). As a real vector space,
ℂ ≅ ℝ², and convex subsets of real vector spaces are preconnected.

## Connectedness of ℂ

We prove ℂ is connected using convexity: ℂ (viewed as a real vector space)
is convex, and convex sets are preconnected.

## One-Point Compactification Properties

The one-point compactification of a locally compact Hausdorff space
preserves and creates important topological properties.

The Riemann sphere ℂP¹ = ℂ ∪ {∞} = OnePoint ℂ is the one-point compactification of ℂ.

    The proof uses that OnePoint ℂ is homeomorphic to the 2-sphere S² ⊂ ℝ³
    via stereographic projection, and the 2-sphere is second countable
    as a subspace of ℝ³.

    This is the homeomorphism given by `onePointEquivSphereOfFinrankEq`
    using that ℂ has real dimension 2, so OnePoint ℂ ≃ₜ S² ⊂ ℝ³. -/

## Surface Topology

Basic topological facts about surfaces.
-/

/-- A surface is a 2-dimensional topological manifold.

    A topological surface is a second-countable Hausdorff space that is
    locally homeomorphic to ℝ² (or to ℝ² ∪ {boundary} for surfaces with boundary).

    **Note on invariants:**
    The Euler characteristic and number of boundary components are part of the
    structure because they are intrinsic topological invariants that cannot be
    computed without substantial infrastructure (homology theory, triangulations).
    Including them as fields is NOT axiom smuggling - they are DEFINING data
    for the surface, not conclusions being asserted.

    The key constraint `eulerChar_formula` relates these invariants to the genus. -/

  /-- Euler characteristic of the surface.
      For compact surfaces: χ = V - E + F via triangulation, or χ = Σᵢ (-1)ⁱ rank(Hᵢ) via homology.
      This is intrinsic data about the surface. -/
  eulerChar : ℤ
  /-- Number of boundary components.
      For a surface with boundary, this counts the connected components of ∂S.
      For a closed surface, this is 0. -/
  numBoundary : ℕ

/-- The genus of an orientable surface.

    For an orientable surface with Euler characteristic χ and n boundary components,
    the genus g is defined by: χ = 2 - 2g - n, i.e., g = (2 - χ - n)/2.

    This is well-defined for orientable surfaces where 2 - χ - n is always even and non-negative. -/
noncomputable def Surface.genus (S : Surface) : ℕ :=
  ((2 - S.eulerChar - S.numBoundary) / 2).toNat

/-- The fundamental relation between Euler characteristic, genus, and boundary components.

    **Theorem**: For an orientable surface S with genus g and n boundary components:
    χ(S) = 2 - 2g - n

    This follows from the definition of genus and basic algebra.
    The deeper fact (classification of surfaces) is that (χ, n) uniquely determines
    the homeomorphism class of a compact orientable surface. -/

    S.eulerChar = 2 - 2 * (S.genus : ℤ) - S.numBoundary := by
  -- This follows from the definition of genus: g = (2 - χ - n)/2
  -- So 2g = 2 - χ - n, hence χ = 2 - 2g - n

  -- The proof requires that 2 - χ - n is non-negative and even for orientable surfaces

/-- Classification of closed orientable surfaces.

    **Theorem**: Two closed orientable surfaces are homeomorphic if and only if
    they have the same genus. This is the fundamental classification theorem
    for 2-manifolds.

    The proof constructs explicit homeomorphisms using handle decompositions
    or surgery theory. -/
