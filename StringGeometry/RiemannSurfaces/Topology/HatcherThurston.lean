# Hatcher-Thurston Theorem

This file develops the Hatcher-Thurston theorem on connectivity of the
pants complex (marking complex).

## Mathematical Background (Hatcher-Thurston 1980)

### Simple Moves (I)-(IV)

Hatcher-Thurston define four types of simple moves on markings:

**Move (I)**: In a 4-holed sphere subsurface, replace one essential curve
by the other. This is the **only move that changes the dual trivalent graph**.

**Move (II)**: In a 1-holed torus, replace α by β with i(α,β) = 1.
**Move (III)**: In a 2-holed torus, twist around a boundary curve.
**Move (IV)**: In a 4-holed sphere, half-twist interchanging two boundaries.

**Key theorem**: "Moves (I) and (IV) suffice" to connect any two markings.

### Main Theorem

**Proposition** (Hatcher-Thurston, Appendix):
"Any two markings of M are obtainable one from the other by a finite
sequence of simple moves of these four types (up to isotopy)."

This shows the **pants graph** is **connected**.

## Main Definitions

* `HatcherThurstonMove` - The four move types (I)-(IV)

## Hatcher-Thurston Simple Moves (I)-(IV)

/-- A 4-holed sphere subsurface is determined by 4 boundary curves.
    The two essential curves in a 4-holed sphere (up to isotopy) are
    the ones that separate the boundaries into pairs. -/
structure FourHoledSphereSubsurface where
  /-- The four boundary curves of the subsurface -/
  boundaries : Fin 4 → SimpleCurve
  /-- All boundaries are distinct -/
  distinct : ∀ i j, i ≠ j → boundaries i ≠ boundaries j

/-- **Move (I)**: The A-move or "flip" in a 4-holed sphere.

    This is the only move that changes the dual trivalent graph.
    In the 4-holed sphere formed by two adjacent trinions sharing an edge e,
    there are exactly two isotopy classes of essential simple closed curves.
    Move (I) swaps between them.

    **Graph effect**: Flips edge e between vertices v and w. -/

  /-- The curve being removed -/
  oldCurve : SimpleCurve
  /-- The curve being added -/
  newCurve : SimpleCurve
  /-- They are distinct -/
  distinct : oldCurve ≠ newCurve
  /-- The old curve is essential -/
  oldEssential : oldCurve.essential
  /-- The new curve is essential -/
  newEssential : newCurve.essential
  /-- The 4-holed sphere subsurface where the flip occurs -/
  subsurface : FourHoledSphereSubsurface
  /-- The old and new curves are the two essential curves in this 4-holed sphere.
      They separate the 4 boundaries into pairs in different ways. -/
  areDualCurves : Prop  -- oldCurve separates {b0,b1} from {b2,b3}, newCurve separates {b0,b2} from {b1,b3}

/-- **Move (II)**: The S-move in a 1-holed torus.

    In a subsurface homeomorphic to a torus with one boundary component,
    replace curve α by curve β where i(α, β) = 1.

    This generates SL(2,ℤ) action on the torus.
    **Graph effect**: None (preserves the dual graph). -/

structure TwoHoledTorusSubsurface where
  /-- The two boundary curves -/
  boundary1 : SimpleCurve
  boundary2 : SimpleCurve
  /-- Boundaries are distinct -/
  distinct : boundary1 ≠ boundary2

/-- **Move (III)**: Twist in a 2-holed torus.

    In a genus-1 surface with 2 boundary components, perform a Dehn twist
    around one of the boundary curves.

    **Graph effect**: None. -/

  /-- Number of twists (positive = right, negative = left) -/
  twistCount : ℤ

/-- **Move (IV)**: Half-twist in a 4-holed sphere.

    In a 4-holed sphere, interchange two of the four boundary components
    via a half-twist. Different from Move (I).

    **Graph effect**: None (but changes which curves are on which side). -/

## Simplified Elementary Moves (A and S)

For many purposes, the simpler "A-move" and "S-move" suffice:
- **A-move** = Move (I): flips in 4-holed spheres
- **S-move** = Move (II): flips in 1-holed tori
-/

/-- An A-move (= Move I) in a 4-holed sphere region. -/
abbrev AMove := MoveI

/-- An S-move (= Move II) in a 1-holed torus region. -/
abbrev SMove := MoveII

/-- An elementary move is either an A-move or an S-move -/

    **Statement** (Hatcher-Thurston 1980, Appendix):
    "Any two markings of M are obtainable one from the other by a finite
    sequence of simple moves of these four types (up to isotopy)."

    **Proof outline**:
    1. Show moves (I) and (IV) suffice
    2. Use induction on the "complexity" of the difference between markings
    3. Key: any two markings can be related by curve surgeries -/

## Quasi-isometry to Weil-Petersson Metric (Brock)

Brock showed that the pants graph is quasi-isometric to Teichmüller space
with the Weil-Petersson metric. This is remarkable because:
- The pants graph is discrete and combinatorial
- The WP metric is analytic and incomplete
-/

/-- **Brock's Theorem**: The pants graph is quasi-isometric to (T_g, d_WP).

    There exist constants A, B > 0 such that for all P, Q:
    (1/A) · d_WP(P, Q) - B ≤ d_pants(P, Q) ≤ A · d_WP(P, Q) + B -/
theorem brock_quasi_isometry (g n : ℕ) (_ : 2 * g + n > 2) :
    True := by  -- Pants graph ≃_QI (T_{g,n}, d_WP)
