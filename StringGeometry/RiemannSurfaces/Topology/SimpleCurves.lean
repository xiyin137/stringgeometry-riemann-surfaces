# Simple Closed Curves on Surfaces

This file develops the theory of simple closed curves on surfaces,
including intersection numbers and disjointness.

## Mathematical Background

A **simple closed curve** on a surface Σ is an embedding S¹ → Σ, considered
up to isotopy. The **geometric intersection number** i(α, β) is the minimum
number of intersection points over all isotopy representatives:

  i(α, β) = min { |α' ∩ β'| : α' ∼ α, β' ∼ β }

Key properties:
- i(α, α) = 0 (any curve is disjoint from itself)
- i(α, β) = i(β, α) (symmetric)
- i(α, β) = 0 iff α and β can be isotoped to be disjoint

## Implementation Note

Since we work with isotopy classes abstractly (without explicit surface
coordinates), intersection numbers are specified axiomatically via an
`IntersectionData` structure. This captures the essential algebraic
properties while allowing concrete computations when surface data is available.

## Main Definitions

* `SimpleCurve` - A simple closed curve (up to isotopy)
* `IntersectionData` - Axiomatic intersection number data
* `SimpleCurve.disjoint` - Two curves are disjoint (i(α, β) = 0)

## Simple Closed Curves
-/

/-- A simple closed curve on a surface Σ (up to isotopy).

    An **essential** simple closed curve is one that:
    - Does not bound a disk (not null-homotopic)
    - Is not homotopic to a boundary component
    - Is not homotopic to a puncture

    We use abstract identifiers since we work with isotopy classes.

    **Note**: Intersection numbers depend on the ambient surface and are
    provided separately via `IntersectionData`. -/

## Intersection Numbers

Intersection numbers are provided axiomatically, as they depend on the
ambient surface structure which we treat abstractly.
-/

/-- Axiomatic data for geometric intersection numbers on a surface.

    This structure provides intersection numbers for curves on a fixed surface,
    satisfying the fundamental properties:
    - i(α, α) = 0 (self-intersection is zero)
    - i(α, β) = i(β, α) (symmetry)

    **Usage**: Create an instance for a specific surface/curve system,
    then use `intersectionNumber` to compute intersections. -/
structure IntersectionData where
  /-- The geometric intersection number i(α, β) -/
  i : SimpleCurve → SimpleCurve → ℕ
  /-- Self-intersection is zero: i(α, α) = 0 -/
  self_zero : ∀ α, i α α = 0
  /-- Symmetric: i(α, β) = i(β, α) -/

/-- Geometric intersection number i(α, β) using provided intersection data.
    This is the minimum number of intersection points over all isotopy representatives.

    **Properties** (from IntersectionData axioms):
    - i(α, α) = 0
    - i(α, β) = i(β, α)

    **Properties** (geometric, require proof):
    - i(α, β) = 0 iff α and β are disjoint
    - Bigon criterion: If α ≠ β and they fill no bigons, i(α,β) = |α ∩ β| -/

/-- Two curves are disjoint if their geometric intersection number is zero.
    This means they can be isotoped to not intersect. -/

/-- Data for which curves are separating on a surface.

    A curve α is **separating** if Σ \ α has two connected components.
    A curve is **non-separating** if Σ \ α is connected.

    **Examples:**
    - On a torus, every essential curve is non-separating
    - On a genus-2 surface, a curve around one handle is separating

    **Property:** On a genus g surface, α is separating iff
    Σ \ α consists of two subsurfaces of genera g₁, g₂ with g₁ + g₂ = g. -/

  /-- A separating curve has two complementary components -/
  separating_components : ∀ α, isSeparating α = true →
    ∃ (g₁ g₂ : ℕ), g₁ + g₂ ≥ 0  -- Placeholder for proper component data

/-- A curve is separating if it disconnects the surface.

    This requires surface data specifying which curves are separating.
    On a surface of genus g, a separating curve divides it into two
    subsurfaces of genera g₁ + g₂ = g. -/
def separating (sd : SeparatingData) (α : SimpleCurve) : Prop :=
  sd.isSeparating α = true

/-- A curve is non-separating if the surface minus the curve is connected.

    Most essential curves on higher genus surfaces are non-separating.
    On a torus (genus 1), all essential curves are non-separating. -/

/-- The effect of a Dehn twist on intersection numbers.

    **Fact**: If τ_α is the Dehn twist around α, then for curves β, γ:
    i(τ_α(β), γ) = |i(α,β)·i(α,γ) + i(β,γ)| when properly oriented.

    More precisely, there's a formula involving signed intersection. -/

## Curve Complexes

The curve complex C(Σ) has vertices = isotopy classes of essential curves
and edges = pairs of disjoint curves.
-/

/-- The curve complex C(Σ_{g,n}).

    **Vertices**: isotopy classes of essential simple closed curves
    **Edges**: pairs of disjoint curves (i(α, β) = 0)
    **k-simplices**: (k+1) pairwise disjoint curves

    **Properties** (Harvey, Masur-Minsky):
    - C(Σ) is connected for 3g - 3 + n ≥ 1
    - C(Σ) is δ-hyperbolic (Masur-Minsky)
    - diam(C(Σ)) = ∞ for 3g - 3 + n ≥ 2 -/

  /-- All vertices are essential -/

  /-- Intersection data for curves on this surface -/
  intersectionData : IntersectionData
  /-- Adjacency: two curves are adjacent iff disjoint (i(α, β) = 0) -/

/-- A path in the curve complex: a sequence of curves where consecutive curves are disjoint -/

  /-- Path is nonempty -/

  consecutive_adj : ∀ i : ℕ, (h : i + 1 < curves.length) →
    C.adj (curves[i]'(by omega)) (curves[i + 1]'h)

/-- The curve complex is connected for stable surfaces.

    **Theorem** (Harvey): For 3g - 3 + n ≥ 1, the curve complex C(Σ_{g,n})
    is connected. Any two essential curves can be connected by a path
    of curves, where adjacent curves are disjoint.

    The proof proceeds by showing any curve can be connected to a
    fixed "standard" curve system. -/

    ∃ (path : CurveComplexPath C), path.curves.head? = some α ∧ path.curves.getLast? = some β := by
  sorry  -- Harvey's connectivity theorem

/-- The curve complex is Gromov δ-hyperbolic (Masur-Minsky).

    **Theorem** (Masur-Minsky 1999): The curve complex C(Σ_{g,n}) is
    δ-hyperbolic for some δ depending only on the topology of the surface.

    This means all geodesic triangles are δ-thin: each side is contained
    in a δ-neighborhood of the union of the other two sides. -/
