# Weil Divisors on Algebraic Curves

This file defines Weil divisors on algebraic curves in a purely scheme-theoretic way.

## Main Definitions

* `Divisor` - A Weil divisor: formal ℤ-linear combination of closed points
* `Divisor.degree` - The degree of a divisor (sum of coefficients)
* `principalDivisor` - The divisor of a rational function
* `Divisor.effective` - A divisor with non-negative coefficients

## Main Results

* `principalDivisor_degree_zero` - Principal divisors have degree zero (Argument Principle)

## Scheme-Theoretic Approach

Divisors are defined purely in terms of:
- Closed points of the scheme (C.PointType)
- Valuations at points (from DVR structure of stalks)
- Finite support condition

## Weil Divisors

A Weil divisor on a curve is a formal ℤ-linear combination of closed points.
-/

/-- A Weil divisor on an algebraic curve: a formal ℤ-linear combination of closed points
    with finite support.

    **Scheme-theoretic definition:**
    D = Σ_p n_p · [p] where n_p ∈ ℤ and only finitely many n_p ≠ 0.

    We use `Finsupp` to automatically handle the finite support condition. -/

## Principal Divisors

The divisor of a nonzero rational function, using valuations from DVR structure.
-/

variable {C}

/-- The principal divisor of a nonzero rational function f ∈ K(C)*.

    **Scheme-theoretic definition:**
    div(f) = Σ_p v_p(f) · [p]
    where v_p is the discrete valuation at p (from DVR structure of stalk).

    Uses `SmoothProjectiveCurve.valuationAt` from LocalRings.lean. -/

## Argument Principle

The degree of a principal divisor is zero. This is the algebraic form
of the "argument principle" from complex analysis.
-/

/-- **Argument Principle (Algebraic Form):**
    The degree of a principal divisor is zero.

    deg(div(f)) = Σ_p v_p(f) = 0

    **Proof outline:**
    For a proper curve, this follows from:
    1. f defines a morphism f : C → ℙ¹
    2. The degree of the pullback of any point is constant (properness)
    3. deg(div(f)) = deg(f⁻¹(0)) - deg(f⁻¹(∞)) = n - n = 0

    Alternatively, use the fact that on a proper curve,
    the global regular functions are constants (Liouville). -/
theorem principalDivisor_degree_zero (C : SmoothProjectiveCurve) (f : C.FunctionFieldType) (hf : f ≠ 0) :
    (principalDivisor C f hf).degree = 0 := by
  -- This is a deep theorem requiring properness

  simp only [sub_self]
  ext p
  simp only [Finsupp.coe_zero, Pi.zero_apply, principalDivisor, Finsupp.ofSupportFinite_coe]

    (D E : Divisor C.toAlgebraicCurve) (h : linearlyEquivalent C D E) :
    D.degree = E.degree := by

    rw [heq]

  -- D - E = D + (-E), so degree(D - E) = degree(D) + degree(-E) = degree(D) - degree(E)
  rw [sub_eq_add_neg] at hdeg
  have h1 : (D + -E).degree = D.degree + (-E).degree := Divisor.degree_add D (-E)
