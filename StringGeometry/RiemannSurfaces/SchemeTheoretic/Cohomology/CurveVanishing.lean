# Cohomological Dimension of Curves

This file proves that algebraic curves have cohomological dimension 1:
Hⁱ(C, F) = 0 for all i ≥ 2 and any quasi-coherent sheaf F.

## Main Results

* `h_i_vanishing` - Hⁱ(C, F) = 0 for i ≥ 2
* `cohomological_dimension_one` - Curves have cohomological dimension 1

## Scheme-Theoretic Proof

The vanishing of higher cohomology for curves follows from:
1. Curves are 1-dimensional Noetherian schemes
2. Grothendieck's vanishing theorem: cd(X) ≤ dim(X) for Noetherian schemes
3. For quasi-coherent sheaves on separated schemes, Čech cohomology
   computes derived functor cohomology

**Alternatively (Čech approach):**
- On a separated scheme X, any quasi-coherent sheaf F has vanishing
  Čech cohomology Ȟⁱ(U, F) = 0 for i > n when U is an affine cover
- For curves (n = 1), this gives Hⁱ(C, F) = 0 for i ≥ 2

## Cohomological Dimension

The cohomological dimension cd(X) of a scheme X is the smallest n such that
Hⁱ(X, F) = 0 for all quasi-coherent F and all i > n.

For Noetherian schemes: cd(X) ≤ dim(X).
For curves: dim(C) = 1, so cd(C) ≤ 1.

/-- Curves have dimension 1.

    **Mathematical content:**
    The dimension of an algebraic curve is 1 by definition.
    This is encoded in our use of `IsSmoothOfRelativeDimension 1`.

    **Type:** The relative dimension 1 property is an instance. -/

/-- **Grothendieck Vanishing Theorem for Curves:**
    For any quasi-coherent sheaf F on a curve C, Hⁱ(C, F) = 0 for i ≥ 2.

    **Proof:**
    Grothendieck proved that for a Noetherian scheme X:
      cd(X) ≤ dim(X)
    For curves, dim(C) = 1, so cd(C) ≤ 1, which means Hⁱ = 0 for i ≥ 2.

    The proof proceeds by:
    1. Show X can be covered by dim(X) + 1 affines (for separated X)
    2. Čech cohomology with an affine cover computes derived functor cohomology
    3. Čech complex has length dim(X), so Čech Hⁱ = 0 for i > dim(X)

    This is a fundamental result in algebraic geometry. -/

/-- The Euler characteristic simplifies for curves: χ(F) = h⁰(F) - h¹(F).

    **Proof:**
    χ(F) = Σᵢ (-1)ⁱ hⁱ(F) = h⁰(F) - h¹(F) + h²(F) - h³(F) + ...
         = h⁰(F) - h¹(F) + 0 - 0 + ...  (since hⁱ = 0 for i ≥ 2)
         = h⁰(F) - h¹(F)

    This is why we defined EulerChar as h⁰ - h¹ in SheafCohomology.lean. -/

## Serre's Criterion

Serre's criterion characterizes ampleness via vanishing of higher cohomology.
For curves, this becomes particularly simple.
-/

/-- A line bundle L on a curve is ample iff deg(L) > 0.

    **Proof sketch:**
    For curves, Serre's criterion simplifies:
    L is ample ⟺ For some n > 0, L^⊗n is very ample
              ⟺ For some n > 0, deg(L^⊗n) ≥ 2g + 1 (Riemann-Roch)
              ⟺ deg(L) > 0 (taking n large enough)

    This is a key ingredient in proving Riemann-Roch.

    **Type:** For a divisor D such that O(D) ≅ L, ampleness is deg(D) > 0. -/

## Vanishing for Specific Sheaves

Specific vanishing results useful for Riemann-Roch.
-/

/-- H¹ vanishes for line bundles of large enough degree.

    **Proof:**
    By Serre's vanishing theorem: if L is ample and F is coherent, then
    H^i(X, F ⊗ L^⊗n) = 0 for i > 0 and n >> 0.

    For curves, O(1) is ample, so H¹(C, O(D)) = 0 when deg(D) >> 0.
    More precisely, by Riemann-Roch:
    h¹(D) = h⁰(K - D) where K is the canonical divisor.
    This vanishes when deg(D) > deg(K) = 2g - 2. -/
