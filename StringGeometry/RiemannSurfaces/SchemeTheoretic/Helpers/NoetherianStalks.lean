# Noetherian Stalks for Smooth Projective Curves

This file proves that stalks of smooth projective curves over ℂ are Noetherian rings.

## Main Results

* `SmoothProjectiveCurve.stalkIsNoetherianRing` - Stalks are Noetherian rings

## Proof Strategy

The proof uses the following chain:
1. ℂ is a Noetherian ring (it's a field)
2. `Spec ℂ` is locally Noetherian
3. Smooth morphisms are locally of finite type
4. If `f : X ⟶ Y` is locally of finite type and `Y` is locally Noetherian, then `X` is locally Noetherian
5. Therefore `C` is locally Noetherian
6. Stalks of locally Noetherian schemes are Noetherian rings

## ℂ is Noetherian

ℂ is a field, hence a Noetherian ring.

/-- ℂ is a Noetherian ring (as a field, every ideal is finitely generated). -/

/-- `CommRingCat.of ℂ` has `IsNoetherianRing` instance. -/

## Spec ℂ is Locally Noetherian

By Mathlib's instance `instIsLocallyNoetherianSpecOfIsNoetherianRingCarrier`,
Spec of a Noetherian ring is locally Noetherian.
-/

/-- `Spec ℂ` is locally Noetherian.

    We show this by noting that `SpecComplex = Spec (CommRingCat.of ℂ)` definitionally,
    and Mathlib provides an instance for `IsLocallyNoetherian (Spec R)` when `R` is Noetherian. -/

  -- SpecComplex = Scheme.Spec.obj (Opposite.op (CommRingCat.of ℂ))
  --             = Spec (unop (op (CommRingCat.of ℂ)))
  --             = Spec (CommRingCat.of ℂ)
  -- The instance for IsLocallyNoetherian (Spec R) when [IsNoetherianRing R] should apply

## Smooth Morphisms are Locally of Finite Type

Smooth morphisms are locally of finite type by definition.

    Smooth morphisms are locally of finite presentation, which implies locally of finite type. -/

## C is Locally Noetherian

By `LocallyOfFiniteType.isLocallyNoetherian`, if `f : X ⟶ Y` is locally of finite type
and `Y` is locally Noetherian, then `X` is locally Noetherian.
-/

/-- The curve C is locally Noetherian.

    **Mathematical content:**
    - The structure morphism `C → Spec ℂ` is locally of finite type (from smoothness)
    - `Spec ℂ` is locally Noetherian (ℂ is a Noetherian ring)
    - A finite type algebra over a Noetherian ring is Noetherian (Hilbert basis theorem)
    - Therefore the coordinate rings of affine opens are Noetherian, making `C` locally Noetherian

    **Proof:**
    Use `isLocallyNoetherian_iff_of_affine_openCover` with the affine cover of C.
    Each affine piece has Noetherian sections because:
    1. LocallyOfFiniteType means the map ℂ → Γ(V) has RingHom.FiniteType
    2. RingHom.FiniteType gives Algebra.FiniteType
    3. By `Algebra.FiniteType.isNoetherianRing`, finitely generated ℂ-algebras are Noetherian -/

## Stalks are Noetherian

By Mathlib's instance for locally Noetherian schemes, stalks are Noetherian rings.
-/

/-- Stalks of the curve are Noetherian rings.

    **Proof:** Uses Mathlib's `instIsNoetherianRingCarrierStalkCommRingCatPresheafOfIsLocallyNoetherian`
    which states that stalks of locally Noetherian schemes are Noetherian rings.

    This is a PROPER DEFINITION (no sorry), using Mathlib's infrastructure. -/
