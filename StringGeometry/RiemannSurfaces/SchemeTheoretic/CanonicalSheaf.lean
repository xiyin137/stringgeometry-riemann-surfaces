# The Canonical Sheaf on Algebraic Curves

This file defines the canonical sheaf (dualizing sheaf) on algebraic curves
using Kähler differentials. This is a purely scheme-theoretic construction.

## Main Definitions

* `KahlerDifferentials` - The sheaf Ω¹_{C/ℂ} of Kähler differentials
* `canonicalSheaf` - The canonical sheaf ω_C = Ω¹_{C/ℂ}
* `canonicalDivisor` - A divisor K such that O(K) ≅ ω_C

## Main Results

* `canonical_sheaf_degree` - deg(K) = 2g - 2
* `canonical_sheaf_is_invertible` - ω_C is a line bundle for smooth curves

## Scheme-Theoretic Construction

**Kähler Differentials:**
For a morphism π : C → Spec ℂ of schemes, the sheaf of Kähler differentials
Ω¹_{C/ℂ} is defined as I/I² where I is the ideal of the diagonal Δ : C → C ×_ℂ C.

For smooth curves over ℂ:
- Ω¹_{C/ℂ} is locally free of rank 1 (a line bundle)
- This is the canonical bundle / dualizing sheaf ω_C
- deg(ω_C) = 2g - 2 where g is the genus

**NO ANALYTIC METHODS:**
We use Kähler differentials (algebraic), NOT residues or contour integration.

## Kähler Differentials

The sheaf of Kähler differentials Ω¹_{C/ℂ} is defined algebraically as I/I²
where I is the ideal of the diagonal. For smooth morphisms, this is locally free.
-/

/-- The sheaf of Kähler differentials Ω¹_{C/ℂ}.

    **Scheme-theoretic definition:**
    For the structure morphism π : C → Spec ℂ, the diagonal Δ : C → C ×_ℂ C
    is a closed immersion with ideal sheaf I ⊆ O_{C ×_ℂ C}.
    Then Ω¹_{C/ℂ} = Δ*(I/I²) is the sheaf of Kähler differentials.

    **Properties:**
    - For smooth π of relative dimension n: Ω¹_{C/ℂ} is locally free of rank n
    - For curves (n = 1): Ω¹_{C/ℂ} is a line bundle

    Mathlib should have this as `Scheme.Ω` or similar. -/

    For smooth π : C → Spec ℂ of relative dimension 1, Ω¹_{C/ℂ}

## The Canonical Sheaf

For a smooth curve, the canonical sheaf ω_C equals the sheaf of differentials Ω¹.
-/

/-- The canonical sheaf (dualizing sheaf) of a smooth projective curve.

    **Definition:**
    ω_C = Ω¹_{C/ℂ}, the sheaf of Kähler differentials.

    **Properties:**
    - ω_C is a line bundle on smooth curves
    - deg(ω_C) = 2g - 2
    - H¹(C, ω_C) ≅ H⁰(C, O_C)^∨ ≅ ℂ (Serre duality)
    - H⁰(C, ω_C) ≅ H¹(C, O_C)^∨ has dimension g -/

## The Canonical Divisor

Any divisor K such that O(K) ≅ ω_C is called a canonical divisor.
-/

/-- A canonical divisor K on C such that O(K) ≅ ω_C.

    **Existence:**
    Since ω_C is a line bundle, and every line bundle on a smooth curve
    arises from a divisor, there exists K with O(K) ≅ ω_C.

    **Non-uniqueness:**
    K is unique only up to linear equivalence: if O(K) ≅ O(K') ≅ ω_C,
    then K ~ K'. -/

## Degree of the Canonical Divisor

The key result: deg(K) = 2g - 2.
-/

/-- The degree of the canonical divisor is 2g - 2.

    **Proof outline:**
    This follows from Riemann-Roch:
    For any divisor D: χ(D) = deg(D) + 1 - g
    For D = K: χ(K) = h⁰(K) - h¹(K)
    By Serre duality: h⁰(K) = h¹(O) = g, and h¹(K) = h⁰(O) = 1
    So χ(K) = g - 1 = deg(K) + 1 - g
    Therefore: deg(K) = 2g - 2

    Alternatively, this can be proven using the Riemann-Hurwitz formula
    for a morphism C → ℙ¹, which is purely algebraic. -/
theorem canonical_divisor_degree :
    (canonicalDivisor C).degree = 2 * (genus C : ℤ) - 2 := by

/-- Corollary: deg(ω_C) = 2g - 2.

    This follows from canonical_divisor_degree since ω_C ≅ O(K). -/

## Cohomology of the Canonical Sheaf

The cohomology of ω_C is related to the cohomology of O_C via Serre duality.
-/

/-- h⁰(ω_C) = g.

    **Proof:**
    By Serre duality: H⁰(C, ω_C) ≅ H¹(C, O_C)^∨
    Since h¹(O_C) = g, we have h⁰(ω_C) = g. -/
theorem h0_canonical_sheaf :

  sorry

/-- h¹(ω_C) = 1.

    **Proof:**
    By Serre duality: H¹(C, ω_C) ≅ H⁰(C, O_C)^∨
    Since h⁰(O_C) = 1, we have h¹(ω_C) = 1. -/
theorem h1_canonical_sheaf :
    h_i C.toProperCurve 1 (canonicalSheaf C).toCoherentSheaf = 1 := by
  sorry

/-- χ(ω_C) = g - 1.

    **Proof:**
    χ(ω_C) = h⁰(ω_C) - h¹(ω_C) = g - 1. -/

## The Canonical Map

For g ≥ 1, the linear system |K| gives a morphism C → ℙ^{g-1}.
-/

/-- For g ≥ 2, the canonical linear system is base-point free if C is not hyperelliptic.

    When g ≥ 2 and C is non-hyperelliptic, the canonical map
    φ_K : C → ℙ^{g-1} is an embedding.

    **Type:** h⁰(K) ≥ g ≥ 2, so the canonical linear system is non-trivial. -/
