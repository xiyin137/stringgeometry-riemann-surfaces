# Bridge: SmoothProjectiveCurve → CompactAlgebraicCurve

This file provides the main bridge from scheme-theoretic smooth projective curves
to the abstract `CompactAlgebraicCurve` structure used elsewhere in the project.

## Main Result

* `SmoothProjectiveCurve.toCompactAlgebraicCurve` - Constructs a `CompactAlgebraicCurve`
  from a `SmoothProjectiveCurve`, showing that scheme theory provides all the axioms.

## Design Principles

This bridge VALIDATES that `CompactAlgebraicCurve`'s axioms are exactly what
scheme theory provides for smooth projective curves over ℂ. All fields in the
constructed `CompactAlgebraicCurve` are DERIVED from the scheme structure
(smooth, proper, integral), not assumed as axioms.

## Field Instance for Function Field

The function field of an integral scheme is a field. We use Mathlib's instance
`Field X.functionField` which is available when `[IsIntegral X]`.
-/

/-- The function field is a field.

    **Mathematical content:**
    For an integral scheme X, the function field K(X) is the stalk at the
    generic point, which is a field (the fraction field of any affine open).

    We derive this from Mathlib's `Field X.functionField` instance, which
    requires `[IsIntegral X]`. Our `toSchemeIsIntegral` provides this.

    **NO PLACEHOLDER:** This uses Mathlib's actual Field instance, not a
    sorry-based definition. -/

## Local Parameters

  (C.exists_localParameter x).choose

## Step 1: Construct the underlying AlgebraicCurve
-/

/-- The underlying AlgebraicCurve structure from a SmoothProjectiveCurve. -/
noncomputable def toAlgebraicCurve : Algebraic.AlgebraicCurve where
  Point := C.PointType
  FunctionField := C.FunctionFieldType
  fieldInst := C.functionFieldIsField
  valuation := C.valuationAt
  valuation_zero := C.valuationAt_zero
  valuation_mul := C.valuationAt_mul
  valuation_add_min := C.valuationAt_add_min
  valuation_finiteSupport := C.valuationAt_finiteSupport

## Step 2: Provide the FunctionFieldAlgebra instance
-/

/-- The FunctionFieldAlgebra instance for the derived AlgebraicCurve.

    **Implementation note:**
    The `valuation_algebraMap` field requires proving that constants have
    valuation 0 everywhere. This is proven in `ConstantValuation.lean`:
    - Constants embed via `constantsEmbed : ℂ →+* K(C)`
    - Constants factor through stalks as units (see `constantsEmbed_eq_algebraMap_unit`)
    - Units in a DVR have valuation 0 (see `extendedVal_unit`)

    This is a PROPER DEFINITION (no sorry). -/
noncomputable instance toAlgebraicCurveFunctionFieldAlgebra :
    Algebraic.FunctionFieldAlgebra C.toAlgebraicCurve where
  algebraInst := C.functionFieldAlgebra
  valuation_algebraMap := fun p c hc => by
    -- algebraMap ℂ C.FunctionFieldType = C.constantsEmbed (by definition of functionFieldAlgebra)
    -- Use valuationAt_constant' from ConstantValuation.lean
    show C.valuationAt p (C.constantsEmbed c) = 0

/-- Convert a SmoothProjectiveCurve to CompactAlgebraicCurve.

    **Main Theorem:**
    Every scheme-theoretic smooth projective curve over ℂ gives rise to
    a `CompactAlgebraicCurve`, validating that the abstract axioms are
    exactly what scheme theory provides. -/
