# Scheme Construction from CompactAlgebraicCurve

This file constructs a scheme from a `CompactAlgebraicCurve`. The key insight is that
the function field K(C) together with the discrete valuations at each point determines
a unique smooth projective curve scheme.

## Construction Overview

1. **Points**: The underlying set is `Option C.Point`:
   - `none` = the generic point η (corresponding to the function field)
   - `some p` = the closed point corresponding to p ∈ C.Point

2. **Topology**: Zariski topology where:
   - Open sets: complements of finite sets of closed points, plus ∅
   - Equivalently: {η} is dense, closed sets are finite unions of closed points

3. **Structure Sheaf**: For an open U:
   - O(U) = ⋂_{p ∈ U, p closed} O_p where O_p is the valuation ring at p
   - O({η}) = K(C) (the function field)

4. **Scheme Property**: This is locally isomorphic to Spec of a ring because:
   - The complement of any closed point is affine (Spec of the valuation ring)
   - These affine opens cover the curve

## Main Definitions

* `CurvePoint` - The type of points (Option C.Point)
* `CurveTopology` - The Zariski topology
* `StructureSheaf` - The sheaf of regular functions
* `CurveScheme` - The resulting scheme

## The Underlying Set

The points of the curve scheme are:
- Generic point η (= none) corresponding to the function field
- Closed points (= some p) for each p ∈ C.Point

## The Zariski Topology

For a curve, the Zariski topology is the cofinite topology on closed points,
plus the generic point is in every nonempty open set.

Closed sets are:
- The empty set
- Finite sets of closed points
- The whole space (which includes the generic point)

Open sets are:
- The empty set
- Complements of finite sets of closed points (these contain the generic point)
- The whole space

## The Structure Sheaf

The structure sheaf O assigns to each open set U the ring of functions
that are regular at all closed points in U.

For a curve:
- O(U) = ⋂_{p ∈ U, p closed} O_p
- O({η}) = K(C) (the function field)
- Stalks: O_{x,η} = K(C), O_{x,p} = O_p (the DVR at p)

## Key Properties

The construction gives a scheme because:
1. Stalks are local rings (generic point: field, closed points: DVRs)
2. There exist affine open covers
-/

/-- The function field is a field, hence a local ring. -/
noncomputable instance functionFieldIsLocalRing : IsLocalRing C.FunctionField :=
  inferInstance

/-- The stalk at the generic point is the function field, which is a local ring (as a field).
    Note: We can't directly make an instance on `stalkType C (genericPoint C)` because
    Lean doesn't automatically reduce the match. Use `functionFieldIsLocalRing` directly. -/

    IsLocalRing C.FunctionField := functionFieldIsLocalRing C

## Summary

This file establishes the foundational infrastructure for constructing a scheme
from a CompactAlgebraicCurve:

1. **CurvePoint** - The underlying set with generic and closed points
2. **zariskiTopology** - The Zariski topology on CurvePoint
3. **regularFunctions** - The presheaf of regular functions
4. **stalkType** - Stalks at each point (K(C) at generic, O_p at closed)

The remaining work to complete the scheme construction:
- Verify the presheaf is actually a sheaf (locality and gluing)
- Prove stalks are local rings (done for generic, need DVR instance for closed)
- Construct affine open covers
- Package everything into Mathlib's Scheme structure

This provides the foundation for the bridge CompactAlgebraicCurve → SmoothProjectiveCurve.
