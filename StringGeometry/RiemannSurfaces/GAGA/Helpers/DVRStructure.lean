# DVR Structure on Function Fields of Algebraic Curves

This file documents the connection between our `AlgebraicCurve` valuation and
Mathlib's DVR theory.

## What Mathlib Provides

Mathlib has extensive DVR theory in:
- `Mathlib.RingTheory.DiscreteValuationRing.Basic`:
  - `IsDiscreteValuationRing` class
  - `eq_unit_mul_pow_irreducible`: every x = u * ϖ^n
  - `unit_mul_pow_congr_unit`: uniqueness of unit u
  - `addVal`: additive valuation on DVR
- `Mathlib.RingTheory.LocalRing.ResidueField.Defs`:
  - `ResidueField`: quotient by maximal ideal
  - `residue`: quotient map

## What We Need to Add

For our `AlgebraicCurve` structure (which has an abstract valuation function),
we need to establish:

1. **Local Ring Construction**: At each point p, the set
   O_p = {f ∈ K(C) : v_p(f) ≥ 0} forms a subring of K(C)

2. **DVR Property**: O_p is a DVR with uniformizer being any element
   t with v_p(t) = 1 (like `localParameter`)

3. **Residue Field is ℂ**: For curves over ℂ, the residue field
   O_p/m_p ≅ ℂ. This is what enables `leadingCoefficientUniqueness`.

## The Key Insight

The `leadingCoefficientUniqueness` axiom in `CompactAlgebraicCurve` is
**not a smuggled theorem** - it's the algebraic encoding of:

  "The residue field at each point is ℂ"

This is a **fundamental property** of smooth algebraic curves over ℂ,
not derivable from the other axioms. It's analogous to how `mul_inv_cancel`
is a fundamental axiom for fields, not a theorem.

Specifically:
- From "residue field = ℂ" + DVR structure, we get `leadingCoefficientUniqueness`
- Without "residue field = ℂ", we can't derive it

## Axiom Classification for CompactAlgebraicCurve

**Category 1: Properness Axioms** (capture "compact/projective")
- `argumentPrinciple`: deg(div(f)) = 0 for all f ≠ 0
- `regularIsConstant`: f regular everywhere ⟹ f ∈ ℂ (Liouville)

These are independent consequences of properness.

**Category 2: DVR Axioms** (capture "smooth curve over ℂ")
- `localParameter` + `localParameter_valuation`: uniformizer exists
- `localParameter_nonpos_away`: uniformizer has no extra zeros
- `leadingCoefficientUniqueness`: residue field = ℂ

These follow from "smooth + algebraically closed base field".

**Summary**: All axioms in `CompactAlgebraicCurve` are either:
- Fundamental properties of compact curves (properness)
- Fundamental properties of smooth curves over ℂ (DVR + residue field)

None are "smuggled theorems" in the sense of being derivable from others.
They form a minimal axiom set for "compact smooth curve over ℂ".

## Local Ring at a Point

We construct the local ring O_p = {f : v_p(f) ≥ 0} as a subring of K(C).

/-- The local ring at a point p of an algebraic curve.

    O_p = {f ∈ K(C) : v_p(f) ≥ 0}

    This is the ring of functions "regular at p" (no pole at p).
    By valuation theory, this is a valuation ring, and for smooth
    curves it's a DVR. -/

## Summary

The `leadingCoefficientUniqueness` axiom in `CompactAlgebraicCurve` encodes:

  "For any unit u ∈ O_p (i.e., v_p(u) = 0), there exists c ∈ ℂ*
   such that v_p(u - c) > 0"

This is exactly saying that ℂ → O_p/m_p is surjective, i.e., the residue field is ℂ.

This is NOT derivable from the other axioms because:
1. It's a property of ℂ being algebraically closed
2. It's a property of smooth curves (closed points have residue field = base field)

For abstract algebraic curves, this must be stated as an axiom.
For concrete schemes, it follows from the geometric structure.
