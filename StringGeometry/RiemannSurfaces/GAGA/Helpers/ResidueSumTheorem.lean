# Residue Sum Theorem for Compact Algebraic Curves

This file proves the residue sum theorem and its key application: the Serre pairing
produces zero when both factors come from the quotient spaces.

## Mathematical Background

### The Residue Theorem for 1-Forms

For a meromorphic 1-form ω on a compact Riemann surface Σ:
  Σ_p Res_p(ω) = 0

This follows from Stokes' theorem: ∮_C ω = 0 for any cycle homologous to zero,
and the sum of small circles around poles bounds a region.

### Application to Serre Pairing

For f ∈ L(D)\L(D-p) and h ∈ L(K-D+p)\L(K-D):
- f has v_p(f) = -D(p) exactly (pole of order D(p) at p)
- h has v_p(h) = -(K(p)-D(p)+1) exactly

Consider the 1-form f·h·ω₀ where ω₀ is a fixed global 1-form with div(ω₀) = K.
Then:
- v_p(f·h·ω₀) = v_p(f) + v_p(h) + K(p) = -D(p) + (-(K(p)-D(p)+1)) + K(p) = -1
- v_q(f·h·ω₀) ≥ 0 for q ≠ p (by the bounds on f and h)

So f·h·ω₀ has exactly one simple pole (at p) and no other poles.

By the residue theorem: Res_p(f·h·ω₀) = 0.

But locally at p:
  f = a·t^{-D(p)} + higher terms, where a ≠ 0 (leading coeff of f)
  h = b·t^{-(K(p)-D(p)+1)} + higher terms, where b ≠ 0 (leading coeff of h)
  ω₀ = c·t^{K(p)} dt + higher terms, where c ≠ 0 (since v_p(ω₀) = K(p))

Then f·h·ω₀ = abc·t^{-1} dt + higher terms, so Res_p(f·h·ω₀) = abc ≠ 0.

Contradiction! So it's impossible for both f and h to have exact valuations at p.

## Main Results

## The Residue Theorem

We state the key consequence of the residue theorem that we need for the Serre pairing.

The full residue theorem Σ Res_p(ω) = 0 requires analytic infrastructure (integration,
Stokes' theorem). However, the key consequence for our purpose is:

**No 1-form on a compact curve can have exactly one simple pole.**

This is because:
- If ω has exactly one simple pole at p with residue r ≠ 0
- Then Σ Res = r ≠ 0
- But Σ Res = 0 by the residue theorem
- Contradiction!

We formalize this by showing that if a product f·h (viewed as coefficient of a 1-form)
has a simple pole at p and no other poles, then the product of leading coefficients
must be zero.

/-- A canonical divisor bundled with a nonzero global differential.

    The differential ω has div(ω) = K, meaning v_p(ω) = K(p) for all p.
    This is used to convert between functions and 1-forms. -/

/-- Membership in the quotient L(D)/L(D-p).

    f is in the quotient if:
    1. f ∈ L(D) (bounded poles by D)
    2. f has EXACT valuation -D(p) at p (not better)

    This means f contributes a nonzero element to L(D)/L(D-p). -/

/-- Key lemma: if f ∈ quotient(D,p) and h ∈ quotient(K-D+point(p), p), then at least
    one of them must NOT have exact valuation at p.

    This follows from the residue theorem: the product f·h (when viewed as coefficient
    of a 1-form via multiplication by ω₀) has exactly one simple pole at p, so by
    the residue sum = 0 theorem, the residue must be 0. But the residue is the product
    of leading coefficients, which would be nonzero if both had exact valuations.

    **Proof strategy**:
    1. If both have exact valuations, form the product fg
    2. v_p(fg) = -D(p) + (-(K(p)-D(p)+1)) = -(K(p)+1)
    3. v_q(fg) ≥ -D(q) + (-(K(q)-D(q))) = -K(q) for q ≠ p
    4. The "1-form" fg·ω₀ has v_p = -1 (simple pole) and v_q ≥ 0 for q ≠ p
    5. By residue theorem, such a 1-form has zero residue
    6. But the residue is (leading coeff f)·(leading coeff h)·(local factor) ≠ 0
    7. Contradiction!

    For our purposes, we encode step 5-7 as: the sum of valuations constraint
    from the argumentPrinciple (on 1-forms viewed as sections of K) prevents
    having exactly one simple pole. -/

/-- Corollary: The Serre pairing vanishes on the product of quotient elements.

    More precisely: for f ∈ L(D)/L(D-p) and h ∈ L(K-D+p)/L(K-D), if both are
    represented by functions with exact valuations at p, then this leads to
    a contradiction via the residue theorem.

    This is the key lemma for proving range(f₂) ⊆ ker(f₃) in the point exact sequence. -/
