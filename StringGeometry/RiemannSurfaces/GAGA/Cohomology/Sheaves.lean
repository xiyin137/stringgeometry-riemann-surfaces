# Sheaves on Riemann Surfaces

This file develops the theory of coherent sheaves on Riemann surfaces, particularly
the structure sheaf O and line bundle sheaves O(D).

## Relationship to Other Files

- **This file (Cohomology/Sheaves.lean)**: Sheaves on **individual** Riemann surfaces Σ.
  Used for Riemann-Roch theorem: H^i(Σ, O(D)).

- **VectorBundles.lean**: Bundles over the **moduli space** M_{g,n}.
  Used for intersection theory: Hodge bundle E, ψ-classes, λ-classes.

- **Divisors.lean**: Defines `Divisor` structure used to parameterize line bundles O(D).

The distinction: here we fix a single curve Σ and study sheaves on it;
VectorBundles.lean studies how these structures vary over the moduli space.

## Mathematical Background

On a Riemann surface Σ, we have:

1. **Structure sheaf O**: The sheaf of holomorphic functions
   - O(U) = {holomorphic f : U → ℂ}
   - This is a sheaf of ℂ-algebras

2. **Line bundle sheaves O(D)**: For a divisor D
   - O(D)(U) = {meromorphic f on U : (f)|_U + D|_U ≥ 0}
   - These are invertible O-modules (rank 1 locally free)

3. **Coherent sheaves**: Finite type O-modules with finite presentation
   - On curves, coherent = locally free ⊕ torsion

## Main Definitions

* `StructureSheaf` - The sheaf O of holomorphic functions
* `LineBundleSheaf` - The sheaf O(D) for a divisor D
* `CoherentSheaf` - Category of coherent O-modules

## Structure Sheaf

The structure sheaf O assigns to each open set U the ring of holomorphic functions on U.
-/

/-- The structure sheaf O of a Riemann surface.

    O(U) = {holomorphic functions f : U → ℂ}

    This is a sheaf of ℂ-algebras. The sheaf axioms are:
    - Locality: if f|_{U_i} = 0 for all i, then f = 0
    - Gluing: if f_i ∈ O(U_i) agree on overlaps, they glue to f ∈ O(⋃U_i)

    **ℂ-algebra structure**: Each O(U) is a ℂ-algebra where the structure map
    ℂ → O(U) includes constant functions. For any c ∈ ℂ, there is a "constant c"
    section in O(U), and evaluating this constant at any point gives c back.

    **Implementation**: We represent O abstractly as a structure carrying
    the assignment of ℂ-algebras to open sets. The actual ring of holomorphic
    functions requires complex analysis infrastructure. -/

  /-- **Evaluation of constants**: Evaluating a constant function at any point gives the constant.
      This is the key compatibility between the ℂ-algebra structure and evaluation.
      For the constant function c ∈ O(U) (represented by algebraMap c), we have ev_p(c) = c.

      This property encodes that O(U) contains all constant functions and evaluation
      works correctly on them. It also implies that evalAt is surjective: for any
      c ∈ ℂ and point p ∈ U, the constant function algebraMap c has ev_p(algebraMap c) = c. -/

      2. Every function f ∈ O(U) with f(p) = 0 is divisible by z: f = z * g for some g ∈ O(U)

      This is a fundamental property of Riemann surfaces: the local ring at each point
      is a discrete valuation ring, and the maximal ideal is principal (generated by z).

      For holomorphic functions, z can be taken as z - z(p) in any local coordinate chart. -/

## Line Bundle Sheaves O(D)

    - O(D + E) ≅ O(D) ⊗_O O(E)
    - O(D) is an invertible O-module (locally free of rank 1)

    **Cohomology**: H^i(Σ, O(D)) are the key objects for Riemann-Roch.

## Canonical Sheaf

The canonical sheaf K = Ω¹ is the sheaf of holomorphic 1-forms.
-/

/-- The canonical sheaf K (sheaf of holomorphic 1-forms).

    K(U) = {holomorphic 1-forms on U}

    In local coordinates z: sections are f(z)dz where f is holomorphic.

    Key properties:
    - K is a line bundle (locally free of rank 1)
    - deg(K) = 2g - 2 (THEOREM: Riemann-Hurwitz, see `canonical_sheaf_degree`)
    - H⁰(K) = g (THEOREM: dimension of holomorphic 1-forms = genus)

    **Note**: The degree property deg(K) = 2g - 2 is NOT a structure field because
    it is a computational result (Riemann-Hurwitz theorem) that must be PROVED.

    For a canonical sheaf on a compact Riemann surface of genus g,
    the degree of the canonical divisor is 2g - 2.

    **Proof approaches:**
    1. Branched covering: Consider π : Σ → ℂP¹ and count ramification
    2. Residue calculus: Use ∮ d(log ω) = 2πi · deg(div ω)
    3. Euler characteristic: χ(Σ) = 2 - 2g and deg(K) = -χ(Σ)

    This requires substantial infrastructure (branched coverings, residue theorem,
    or Euler characteristic computations) which is not yet available. -/

## Category of Coherent Sheaves

Coherent sheaves form an abelian category, which is essential for cohomology.
-/

/-- A coherent sheaf on a Riemann surface with respect to a structure sheaf O.

    A coherent O-module F is:
    1. A sheaf of O-modules: each F(U) is an O(U)-module, satisfying sheaf axioms
    2. Of finite type: locally generated by finitely many sections
    3. Finitely presented: kernel of any finite surjection O^n → F is also finite type

    On a curve, every coherent sheaf decomposes as:
    F = (locally free part) ⊕ (torsion part)

    **Key theorem**: The category of coherent sheaves is abelian.

    **O(U)-module structure**: Each F(U) is a module over the ring O(U) of holomorphic
    functions on U. The module action f · s for f ∈ O(U), s ∈ F(U) represents
    pointwise multiplication of a section by a holomorphic function.

    **Compatibility with restrictions**: For V ⊆ U, the restriction F(U) → F(V)

## Tensor Products and Duality

Operations on line bundles corresponding to divisor arithmetic.

**Note**: The full tensor product L_D ⊗_O L_E and dual L* constructions require
the O(U)-module tensor product L_D(U) ⊗_{O(U)} L_E(U), which is more complex
than the ℂ-tensor product. For curves, these give line bundles:
- O(D) ⊗_O O(E) ≅ O(D + E)
- O(D)* = Hom_O(O(D), O) ≅ O(-D)

These constructions are defined in a more abstract setting where we track
divisors and their arithmetic, leaving the explicit O-module tensor for
further development.
