# Divisors on Algebraic Curves (Pure Algebraic Approach)

This file develops the theory of divisors on algebraic curves from a purely
algebraic perspective, without reference to Riemann surfaces or complex manifolds.

## Main Definitions

* `Divisor` - Formal sum of points with integer coefficients
* `Divisor.degree` - Sum of coefficients
* `principalDivisor` - The divisor div(f) of a nonzero function
* `LinearlyEquivalent` - D₁ ~ D₂ iff D₁ - D₂ is principal
