# Function Fields of Algebraic Curves

This file defines the function field K(C) of an algebraic curve and meromorphic functions
as elements of the function field. This is the **algebraic approach** to meromorphic functions.

## Mathematical Background

For a smooth projective algebraic curve C over ℂ:
- The function field K(C) is the field of rational functions on C
- An element f ∈ K(C) is a meromorphic function on C
- At each point p ∈ C, there is a discrete valuation v_p : K(C)* → ℤ
- The order of f at p is ord_p(f) = v_p(f)

Key properties:
- v_p(fg) = v_p(f) + v_p(g)
- v_p(f + g) ≥ min(v_p(f), v_p(g))
- v_p(f) > 0 iff p is a zero of f
- v_p(f) < 0 iff p is a pole of f
- v_p(f) ≠ 0 for only finitely many p (for f ≠ 0)

## Why This Is The Correct Definition

Unlike a "bundled" definition that just records (value, order) pairs with consistency axioms,
this definition is grounded in algebraic geometry:

1. The function field K(C) is a concrete mathematical object
2. A meromorphic function IS an element of K(C), not a separate structure
3. The valuation v_p comes from the local ring structure at p
4. All properties follow from the algebraic structure, not axioms

## Key Definitions

* `AlgebraicCurve` - A smooth projective algebraic curve with function field
* `AlgebraicCurve.FunctionField` - The function field K(C)
* `AlgebraicCurve.MeromorphicFunction` - Alias for elements of K(C)
* `AlgebraicCurve.valuation` - The discrete valuation v_p at each point

## Algebraic Curve Structure

An algebraic curve over ℂ, abstracted to capture the essential properties
needed for function field theory.
-/

/-- An algebraic curve over ℂ.

    This is an abstract structure capturing a smooth projective curve.
    The key data is:
    - `Point`: The set of closed points C(ℂ)
    - `FunctionField`: The field K(C) of rational functions

    The structure includes the discrete valuation at each point, which
    gives the algebraic definition of order for meromorphic functions.

    **Mathematical context:**
    In algebraic geometry, a smooth projective curve C over ℂ has:
    - A function field K(C) = Frac(O_C,η) where η is the generic point
    - At each closed point p, a discrete valuation ring O_{C,p} ⊆ K(C)
    - The valuation v_p : K(C)* → ℤ measures order of vanishing/pole at p -/

  /-- The discrete valuation at each point p: v_p : K(C)* → ℤ
      Encodes order of vanishing/pole at p -/
  valuation : Point → FunctionField → ℤ
  /-- **Convention:** v_p(0) = 0.

      **Mathematical note:** In valuation theory, v_p(0) is formally +∞. However, we
      use 0 as a convention because:
      1. All meaningful operations (`valuation_mul`, `valuation_inv`) are only
         stated for nonzero elements, avoiding the 0 case entirely.
      2. This avoids the complexity of `WithTop ℤ` throughout the codebase.
      3. When computing divisors or supports, we always require f ≠ 0.

      The convention is safe because we never use v_p(0) in proofs that would
      require the ∞ value. The axiom `valuation_mul` explicitly requires f, g ≠ 0,
      so the potential inconsistency 0 = v_p(0) = v_p(0 · 1) = v_p(0) + v_p(1) = 0 + 0
      doesn't arise from the axioms. -/

  /-- **Ultrametric inequality:** v_p(f + g) ≥ min(v_p(f), v_p(g)) when f + g ≠ 0.

      This is the fundamental property of discrete valuations that makes
      the valuation ring O_p = {f : v_p(f) ≥ 0} into a ring.

      Note: We require f + g ≠ 0 because our convention sets v_p(0) = 0,
      which could violate the inequality in degenerate cases like f = -g. -/

## ℂ-Algebra Structure on Function Fields

The function field K(C) of an algebraic curve over ℂ is naturally a ℂ-algebra:
the constant functions embed ℂ into K(C).

Key property: constant functions have valuation 0 everywhere (no zeros or poles).
-/

/-- A ℂ-algebra structure on the function field of an algebraic curve.

    **Mathematical content:**
    For an algebraic curve C over ℂ, the structure morphism ℂ → K(C) embeds
    ℂ as the constant functions. These have no zeros or poles, so v_p(c) = 0
    for all p and all nonzero c ∈ ℂ.

    This is essential for:
    1. RiemannRochSpace L(D) being a ℂ-vector space
    2. h⁰(D) = dim_ℂ L(D) making sense

## Algebraic Meromorphic Functions

A meromorphic function on an algebraic curve is simply an element of the function field K(C).
This is the **correct algebraic definition** - no separate structure needed.
-/

/-- A meromorphic function on an algebraic curve is an element of its function field.

    **This is the correct algebraic definition.**

    Unlike the "bundled" approach that just records data, this definition
    is mathematically grounded: f ∈ K(C) automatically has all the properties
    of a meromorphic function because K(C) is defined as the field of rational
    functions on C.

    The order at each point comes from the discrete valuation v_p, which is
    intrinsic to the algebraic structure of the curve. -/

## The Argument Principle (Algebraic Version)

On an algebraic curve, the argument principle states that for any
nonzero f ∈ K(C), the degree of its divisor is zero:

  deg(div(f)) = Σ_p v_p(f) = 0

This is sometimes stated as "principal divisors have degree zero".
-/

/-- A compact algebraic curve (smooth projective curve over ℂ).

    This structure captures the essential properties of a smooth projective
    algebraic curve over ℂ. The axioms fall into two categories:

    **Category 1: Properness Axioms** (capture "compact/projective")
    - `argumentPrinciple`: deg(div(f)) = 0 for all f ≠ 0
    - `regularIsConstant`: f regular everywhere ⟹ f ∈ ℂ (Liouville)

    **Category 2: DVR Axioms** (capture "smooth curve over ℂ")
    - `localParameter` + `localParameter_valuation`: uniformizer exists
    - `localParameter_nonpos_away`: uniformizer has no extra zeros
    - `leadingCoefficientUniqueness`: residue field at each point is ℂ

    These are **not smuggled theorems** - they form a minimal axiom set.
    See `Helpers/DVRStructure.lean` for detailed analysis showing that
    none of these are derivable from the others.

    In particular, `leadingCoefficientUniqueness` encodes "residue field = ℂ"
    which is a fundamental property of smooth curves over algebraically closed
    fields, not derivable from DVR theory alone. -/
structure CompactAlgebraicCurve extends AlgebraicCurve where
  /-- The ℂ-algebra structure on the function field -/
  [algebraInst : FunctionFieldAlgebra toAlgebraicCurve]
  /-- The genus of the curve -/
  genus : ℕ
  /-- The argument principle: degree of any principal divisor is zero.

      **Mathematical content:**
      This follows from the fact that on a compact curve, a rational function
      f : C → ℙ¹ is a finite morphism of degree d, so it has exactly d zeros
      (with multiplicity) and d poles (with multiplicity).

      Proof approaches:
      1. Algebraic: The Picard group Pic⁰(C) is the kernel of deg: Div(C) → ℤ,
         and principal divisors lie in Pic⁰(C).
      2. Topological: f: C → ℙ¹ is a branched covering, fiber cardinality is constant.
      3. Analytic (via GAGA): Residue theorem, ∮ f'/f = 0 on compact surfaces. -/
  argumentPrinciple : ∀ (f : FunctionField) (hf : f ≠ 0),
    toAlgebraicCurve.orderSum f hf = 0
  /-- **Properness**: Regular (pole-free) functions are constant.

      **Mathematical content:**
      On a proper (complete) algebraic variety over an algebraically closed field,
      a regular function is constant. For curves, this means:
      If f ∈ K(C) satisfies v_p(f) ≥ 0 for all p ∈ C, then f ∈ ℂ.

      **Proof sketch**:
      1. A regular function f has no poles, defining a morphism f : C → 𝔸¹
      2. Since C is proper and 𝔸¹ is affine, f factors through a point
      3. (Alternatively: f extends to f : C → ℙ¹, and if f ≠ const, the image
         is ℙ¹, but then f⁻¹({∞}) ≠ ∅, contradiction with f having no poles)

      This is the algebraic version of the Liouville theorem. -/

    ∃ (c : ℂ), f = @algebraMap ℂ FunctionField _ _ algebraInst.algebraInst c
  /-- **Local parameter existence**: At each point p, there exists a local parameter.

      **Mathematical content:**
      For any point p on a smooth algebraic curve, the maximal ideal m_p of the
      local ring O_{C,p} is principal, generated by a single element t_p called
      a local parameter (or uniformizing parameter).

      Properties of a local parameter t_p:
      - v_p(t_p) = 1 (t_p vanishes to first order at p)
      - m_p = (t_p) in the local ring O_{C,p}

      This follows from the fact that smooth curves are regular schemes of dimension 1,
      hence their local rings are DVRs (discrete valuation rings), which have principal
      maximal ideals. -/
  localParameter : Point → FunctionField
  localParameter_valuation : ∀ p, toAlgebraicCurve.valuation p (localParameter p) = 1
  /-- **Local parameters have no other zeros**: v_q(t_p) ≤ 0 for q ≠ p.

      By the argument principle (Σ v_q(t_p) = 0) and v_p(t_p) = 1, the local
      parameter t_p must have a pole somewhere. This axiom says t_p has no
      additional ZEROS (only at p), but may have poles at other points.

      Geometrically: t_p is a function with a simple zero at p and poles
      elsewhere that balance out to total degree 0. -/
  localParameter_nonpos_away : ∀ p q, p ≠ q → toAlgebraicCurve.valuation q (localParameter p) ≤ 0
  /-- **Leading coefficient uniqueness** (DVR property).

      For f, g ∈ K(C)* with v_p(f) = v_p(g) = -m < 0 (same pole order at p),
      there exists c ∈ ℂ* such that g - cf has strictly higher valuation at p.

      **Mathematical content:**
      In the local ring O_{C,p} (a DVR), any nonzero element f can be written as
      f = u · t_p^{v_p(f)} where u is a unit. For f, g with the same valuation -m,
      we have f = u_f · t_p^{-m} and g = u_g · t_p^{-m}. Taking c = u_g(p)/u_f(p)
      (the ratio of leading coefficients), we get g - cf = 0 or v_p(g - cf) > -m.

      This is the key property that makes L(D)/L(D-p) at most 1-dimensional. -/

/-- **Short exact sequence dimension formula (leading coefficient extraction)**.

    DERIVED from `leadingCoefficientUniqueness` + `localParameter` - not an axiom.

    For any f ∈ K(C)* with v_p(f) < 0 (a pole at p), there exists c ∈ ℂ* such that
    v_p(f - c · t_p^{v_p(f)}) > v_p(f).

    **Proof:** Apply `leadingCoefficientUniqueness` with g = f and f' = t_p^{v_p(f)}.
    If f - c * t_p^n ≠ 0, the lemma gives v_p(f - c * t_p^n) > v_p(f).
    If f - c * t_p^n = 0, then v_p(0) = 0 > v_p(f) since v_p(f) < 0. -/

## Example: The Projective Line

The projective line ℙ¹ is the simplest example of a compact algebraic curve (genus 0).
- Points: ℂ ∪ {∞} (represented as ℂ ⊕ Unit)
- Function field: ℂ(z) = RatFunc ℂ

The full construction of ℙ¹ as a CompactAlgebraicCurve requires:
1. Valuation at finite points: v_z(f) = (mult of z in numerator) - (mult of z in denominator)
2. Valuation at infinity: v_∞(f) = deg(denom) - deg(numer)
3. Proof that these satisfy the valuation axioms

This infrastructure is partially available in `Helpers/RiemannSphere.lean` using
polynomial root multiplicities. See that file for the ℙ¹-specific argument principle.
