# Zariski Topology on Algebraic Curves

This file defines the Zariski topology on algebraic curves and establishes
the key topological properties needed for Čech cohomology.

## Mathematical Background

For a smooth algebraic curve C over ℂ, the **Zariski topology** on the set
of closed points has:
- **Closed sets**: Finite sets of points, the empty set, or the whole curve
- **Open sets**: Complements of finite sets (cofinite sets) plus the empty set

This is precisely the **cofinite topology**.

## Key Properties

1. **T1 space**: Points are closed
2. **Noetherian**: Descending chain condition on closed sets
3. **NOT Hausdorff**: For infinite curves, distinct points don't have disjoint neighborhoods

## Main Definitions

* `AlgebraicCurve.instTopologicalSpace` - The Zariski (cofinite) topology
* `ZariskiOpen` - Zariski open subsets
* `principalOpen` - Principal open D(f) = {p : v_p(f) ≥ 0}

## Zariski Topology Instance

For an algebraic curve C, we equip C.Point with the cofinite topology,
which equals the Zariski topology for curves.

## Principal Open Sets

For f ∈ K(C)*, the principal open D(f) consists of points where f is regular:
  D(f) = {p ∈ C : v_p(f) ≥ 0}

The complement is the pole locus of f, which is finite.

    This is the complement of the pole locus, hence Zariski open. -/
