# Boundary Stratification of M̄_g

This file describes the boundary stratification of the Deligne-Mumford
compactification M̄_g.

## Mathematical Background

The boundary ∂M̄_g = M̄_g \ M_g consists of stable curves with at least one node.
It has a natural stratification by dual graphs (combinatorial types):

  ∂M̄_g = ⋃_Γ Δ_Γ

where Δ_Γ parametrizes stable curves with dual graph Γ.

### Irreducible Components

The boundary ∂M̄_g has ⌊g/2⌋ + 1 irreducible components (divisors):
- **Δ_0**: Non-separating node (one component of genus g-1 with self-loop)
- **Δ_i** (1 ≤ i ≤ ⌊g/2⌋): Separating node (components of genus i and g-i)

## Main Definitions

* `BoundaryDivisorType` - Types of irreducible boundary divisors
