# Dual Graphs of Nodal Curves

This file defines the dual graph (also called the combinatorial type) of a nodal curve.

## Mathematical Background

For a nodal curve C, the dual graph Γ(C) encodes:
- **Vertices**: Irreducible components of C
- **Edges**: Nodes (ordinary double points) of C
- **Genus labels**: Geometric genus of each component
- **Self-loops**: Nodes where a component meets itself

The dual graph determines the topology of the nodal curve:
- Arithmetic genus: g_a(C) = Σ_v g(v) + b₁(Γ)
- Connected: C is connected iff Γ is connected

## Main Definitions

* `DualGraph` - The dual graph of a nodal curve
* `DualGraph.vertexStable` - Stability condition at a vertex
* `DualGraph.isStable` - A stable dual graph
* `DualGraph.totalGenus` - Arithmetic genus from dual graph

/-- A node (ordinary double point) on a curve.

    Locally, a node looks like the origin in the curve xy = 0 in ℂ².
    It is the mildest kind of singularity on a curve.

    We represent a node as a pair of distinct points on the normalization
    that map to the same point on the nodal curve. -/

  branch1 : NormalizationPoints

  /-- The branches are distinct -/
  distinct : branch1 ≠ branch2

/-- The dual graph of a nodal curve.

    The dual graph Γ(C) encodes the combinatorial structure:
    - Vertices = irreducible components of C
    - Edges = nodes of C (each edge connects two vertices)
    - Genus labels = geometric genus of each component

    This is a proper combinatorial definition using Mathlib's SimpleGraph. -/
