# Combinatorial Approach to Moduli Space via Penner/Kontsevich

This file develops the **Penner-Kontsevich cell decomposition** of moduli spaces
of Riemann surfaces using metric ribbon graphs.

## The Main Theorem: Cell Decomposition

**Penner's Theorem (1987)**: There is a homeomorphism (the "Penner map")

  T̃_{g,n} ≅ M_{g,n}^{comb} := ∐_{[Γ]} ℝ_{>0}^{E(Γ)} / Aut(Γ)

where:
- T̃_{g,n} is the **decorated Teichmüller space** (marked hyperbolic surfaces
  with horocycles at cusps)
- The union is over **equivalence classes of ribbon graphs** Γ of type (g,n)
- Each **cell** is parametrized by positive edge lengths: ℝ_{>0}^{E(Γ)}
- The quotient by Aut(Γ) accounts for graph symmetries

This gives a **cell decomposition** of T̃_{g,n}, and descending to M_{g,n}
via the mapping class group gives a cell decomposition of moduli space.

## Kontsevich's Application

Kontsevich used this cell decomposition to:

1. **Compute intersection numbers** ⟨τ_{d₁} ⋯ τ_{dₙ}⟩_g via sums over graphs
2. **Prove the Witten conjecture** relating intersection theory to KdV hierarchy
3. **Express volumes** as explicit integrals over graph cells

The key formula for ψ-class integrals:
  ⟨τ_{d₁} ⋯ τ_{dₙ}⟩_g = Σ_Γ (1/|Aut(Γ)|) ∫_{ℝ_{>0}^{E(Γ)}} (contribution from Γ)

## Two Constructions of the Map: Penner and Kontsevich

There are two equivalent constructions of the isomorphism M_{g,n} × ℝ^n_+ ≅ M_{g,n}^{comb}:

### Penner's Construction (Hyperbolic Geometry, 1987)
Penner's map is constructed by:
1. Take a **decorated hyperbolic surface** (Σ, h₁, ..., hₙ) with horocycles at cusps
2. Build the **spine** - a deformation retract that is a metric graph
3. The cyclic orderings at vertices come from the surface orientation
4. This produces a metric ribbon graph

### Kontsevich's Construction (Complex Analysis, 1992)
Kontsevich's map uses **Strebel differentials**:
1. Take a Riemann surface C with marked points and positive "perimeters" (p₁, ..., pₙ)
2. There exists a unique meromorphic quadratic differential φ whose
   horizontal trajectories form circles around each marked point with length pᵢ
3. The **critical graph** of φ (zeros and horizontal trajectories) is a ribbon graph
4. Edge lengths come from |φ|^{1/2} along trajectories

**Kontsevich's Theorem 2.2**: The map M_{g,n} × ℝ^n_+ → M^{comb}_{g,n} which
associates to (C, p₁,...,pₙ) the critical graph of the canonical φ-differential
is **one-to-one**.

Both stratifications are **combinatorially equivalent** but geometrically different.
-/

/-!
### Permutation Representation of Ribbon Graphs (Kontsevich)

There is an equivalence between:
1. Ribbon graphs without isolated vertices
2. Triples (X, s₀, s₁) where X is a finite set, s₀, s₁ ∈ Aut(X), s₁ is a free involution
3. Cell decompositions of closed oriented surfaces (excluding S² = D⁰ ∪ D²)

Here s₁ changes edge orientation and s₀ cyclically permutes edges at a vertex.
The set s₂ := s₀⁻¹ ∘ s₁ determines the faces (boundary components).
-/

/-- The Penner map from decorated Teichmüller space to metric ribbon graphs.

    **Construction**:
    Given a decorated hyperbolic surface (Σ, h₁, ..., hₙ) where hᵢ are horocycles
    at the cusps, the Penner map produces a metric ribbon graph by:

    1. **Spine construction**: Each cusp has a canonical "ideal triangle"
       decomposition determined by the horocycles
    2. **Dual graph**: The dual to this decomposition is a ribbon graph
    3. **Metric**: Edge lengths come from hyperbolic geometry

    **Key property**: This is a homeomorphism (Penner 1987). -/

    1. φ has at most simple poles at the marked points
