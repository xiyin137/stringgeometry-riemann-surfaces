## Near-Term Development Focus

### Priority 1: Long Exact Sequence for Spectrum Maps
**File:** `Spectra/HomotopyGroups.lean`

The key missing piece for computing stable homotopy groups is the long exact sequence
associated with a map of spectra f : E → F. This involves:

1. **Cofiber spectrum Cf** - Given f : E → F, define the cofiber spectrum levelwise
   - (Cf)_n = cofiber(f_n : E_n → F_n)
   - Structure maps from the levelwise cofiber sequence

2. **Induced maps on stable homotopy groups**
   - f_* : π_k(E) → π_k(F)
   - i_* : π_k(F) → π_k(Cf)  (cofiber inclusion)
   - ∂ : π_k(Cf) → π_{k-1}(E)  (connecting map)

3. **Exactness** - Prove the sequence is exact:
   ```
   ... → π_k(E) → π_k(F) → π_k(Cf) → π_{k-1}(E) → ...
   ```

**Dependencies:** Uses existing infrastructure from Sequences.lean (fiber_sequence_ker_eq_im)
and the stable homotopy group quotient construction.

### Priority 2: Cofiber Spectrum Definition ◐
**File:** `Spectra/Cofiber.lean`

Define the cofiber of a spectrum map and verify it forms a spectrum:
- [x] `cofiberSpaceAt`: (Cf)_n = mappingCone(f_n)
- [x] `cofiberStructureMap`: structure map Cf_n → Ω(Cf_{n+1})
- [x] `cofiberSpectrum`: the cofiber spectrum Cf for f : E ⟶ F
- [x] `cofiberInclusionSpectrum`: inclusion F → Cf (comm proof pending)
- [ ] `cofiberInclusionSpectrum.comm`: compatibility with structure maps
- [ ] `connectingMapSpectrum`: connecting map Cf → E[1]
- [ ] Long exact sequence for stable homotopy groups

### Priority 3: Induced Maps on Stable π_k ✓ COMPLETED
**File:** `Spectra/HomotopyGroups.lean`

For a spectrum map f : E ⟶ F, define:
- [x] `stableπInduced f : StableHomotopyGroup E k → StableHomotopyGroup F k`
- [x] Well-defined on the quotient (via `colimitTermInduced_preserves_equiv`)
- [x] Functoriality: `stableπInduced_id`, `stableπInduced_comp`

### Priority 4: Group Structure on Stable π_k ◐
**File:** `Spectra/HomotopyGroups.lean`

The stable homotopy groups should be abelian groups (not just sets):
- [x] `inducedπ_mul`: induced maps preserve multiplication (WeakEquivalence.lean)
- [x] `inducedGenLoop_transAt`: induced maps commute with transAt
- [x] `structureMapInduced_mul`: structure map induced preserves multiplication
- [x] `transitionMap_mul`: full transition map preserves multiplication
- [x] `groupStartIndex`: minimum level for group structure
- [x] `levelIndex_ge_one_at_groupStart`: at groupStartIndex, level index ≥ 1
- [ ] Define addition on StableHomotopyGroup using the group structure on π_{n+k}(E_n)
- [ ] Prove well-defined on quotient
- [ ] Prove abelian group axioms
- [ ] Prove induced maps are group homomorphisms

## Remaining Sorrys (6 total)

### EilenbergMacLane.lean (1 sorry) - BLOCKED
- `eilenbergMacLane_unique` - Uniqueness of EM spectra
   - Requires: Uniqueness of K(R,n) spaces up to weak equivalence
   - Note: K(R,n) spaces are not defined in Mathlib; this is deep infrastructure
   - **Status:** Not a near-term priority. Would require building CW complex theory from scratch.

---

## Design Principles

1. **Sound definitions**: No placeholders, no axioms, no arbitrary choices
2. **Build on Mathlib**: Use existing TopCat, homotopy infrastructure
3. **Category-theoretic**: Define as categories/functors where possible
4. **Prove as we go**: Don't accumulate sorrys
