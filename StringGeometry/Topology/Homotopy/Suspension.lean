# Loop Space and Reduced Suspension

This file defines the loop space and reduced suspension functors on pointed topological spaces,
which are fundamental for stable homotopy theory.

## Main Definitions

* `PointedTopSpace.LoopSpace` - The loop space Ω(X, x₀) as a pointed space
* `PointedTopSpace.ReducedSuspension` - The reduced suspension ΣX as a pointed space
* Structure maps for the Σ ⊣ Ω adjunction

## Mathematical Background

For a pointed space (X, x₀):
- The loop space Ω(X, x₀) consists of continuous paths γ : I → X with γ(0) = γ(1) = x₀
- The reduced suspension ΣX = (X × I) / (X × {0} ∪ X × {1} ∪ {x₀} × I)

The fundamental property is the adjunction: [ΣX, Y]₊ ≃ [X, ΩY]₊
