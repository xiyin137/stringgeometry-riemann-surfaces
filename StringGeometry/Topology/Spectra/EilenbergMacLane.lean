# Eilenberg-MacLane Spectra

This file defines the structure of Eilenberg-MacLane spectra, which represent
ordinary cohomology theories.

## Main Definitions

* `EilenbergMacLaneSpectrum` - Structure specifying an EM spectrum for an abelian group

## Mathematical Background

The Eilenberg-MacLane spectrum HR for an abelian group R requires:
1. Eilenberg-MacLane spaces K(R, n) with π_n(K(R,n)) = R and π_k(K(R,n)) = 0 for k ≠ n
2. Weak equivalences K(R, n) ≃_w Ω(K(R, n+1))

This represents ordinary cohomology: H^n(X; R) ≅ [Σ^∞X, Σ^n HR]

## Status

This is a SPECIFICATION of what an Eilenberg-MacLane spectrum should satisfy.
The actual construction of K(R, n) spaces requires substantial infrastructure
not currently available in Mathlib:
- CW complex constructions
- Explicit construction of K(R, n) as iterated fibrations
- Uniqueness theorems

/-! ## Eilenberg-MacLane Spectra

We define the STRUCTURE of an Eilenberg-MacLane spectrum as a package of:
- A spectrum E
- A proof that E is an Ω-spectrum
- Evidence that the homotopy groups satisfy the EM property

This is NOT an axiom - it's a specification. To create an instance, one must
actually construct K(R,n) spaces and prove all properties.

/-- An Eilenberg-MacLane spectrum for an abelian group R is an Ω-spectrum HR
    satisfying the characteristic homotopy group property:
    - π_0(HR) ≅ R
    - π_k(HR) = 0 for k ≠ 0

    This is a STRUCTURE, not an axiom. To construct an instance, one must:
    1. Build Eilenberg-MacLane spaces K(R, n)
    2. Assemble them into a spectrum
    3. Prove the Ω-spectrum property
    4. Prove the homotopy group characterization

    Note: The full formulation would use the stable homotopy groups StableHomotopyGroup.
    Since those depend on the loop-space isomorphism (which has sorrys), we use
    a simplified statement here. -/

  /-- The 0-th level space has homotopy concentrated in degree 0
      (where the group structure is R). A full formulation would state:
      - π_0(spectrum.spaceAt 0) ≅ R as groups
      - π_k(spectrum.spaceAt n) = 0 for k ≠ n
      For now, we use the level-0 bijection. -/

/-- Two Eilenberg-MacLane spectra for the same group are equivalent as spectra.
    This is a consequence of the uniqueness of K(R, n) spaces up to weak equivalence.

    Note: This theorem requires the uniqueness of K(R, n) spaces, which is
    substantial infrastructure not currently available. The proof is left as sorry
    until K(R, n) construction and uniqueness theorems are formalized. -/
